                <p>
                    Web tracking is not that new, I mean I been hearing about like during the last 2 years: I mean, is new but is not.
                  </p>
          
                  <p> I seems that this company (we're gonna called them <q>R</q>) implemented a web-tracking software in the UK, Germany and France to
                    reveal some insights. By that time they were, probably, one of the first marketing research to
                    try that seriously
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <q>R</q> wanted to <q>use web navigation data to explain the online behaviour of a given target in regards to a given topic.
                      For almost two years, in France, Germany and the UK; basically, they have continuously <strong>monitored the online behaviour of a sample of
                        around 2,000 people</strong> in each of the three countries (one billion data points, according with them).
                      This company implemented a small software solution, which allows it to backtrack visited URLs for an hour before and after visiting a
                      website, before taking these inputs and creating monographs of visited websites – revealing consumers' <strong>online journeys</strong>.
                      This data helps the qualitative researcher understand the underlying logic behind user web navigation, especially in scenarios
                      where it is difficult to find a logical pattern in the journey.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Well, this is what they said, but let me state something about <q>understand the underlying logic behind user web navigation</q>. First of all,<strong> I don't think <dfn>every consumer behavior is guided (therefore
                        understood) as the consequence of a logical pattern</dfn> </strong>. Emotions have a lot to do with consumers decisiones, and 
                      Internet behavior is not different. On the contrary, what we saw daily on Facebook, Twitter and the so is a lot a behaviors that are, if
                      not emotional, partially rooted on that, on emotions, not on ideas; on the subconscious; on models that people are not aware on.
                  </p>
                   
                  <h2>Mixin</h2>
                  
                  <p>
                    This <q>R</q> company did the following: they installed a software that allow them to get all the webpages 2000
                    participants visited, all the apps they used and for how long, among other details. For example, the were able to track <q>a
                      person who
                      was looking for an organic facial serum... and who finally bought cosmetics, but neither organic, nor facial serum completely
                      different products!</q>. They took data like this to settled it as a part of the analysis of <strong>the purchase process analysis
                    </strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Based on data, <q>R</q> created a cluster segmentation of <q>buyers</q>, <q>doers</q>, <q>streamers</q>, etc. The doers, for example,
                    have a prevalent tendency to use Internet as a tool to pay taxes and things like that. One interesting thing is the possible
                    mixing between data science and qualitative research: <q>at this point it is pure data science quantitative analysis, and it requests
                      to
                      deal with a huge amount of data (as for now, we have already collected almost one billion data points), and some specific
                      knowledge in programming and statistics. But we will see later that this kind of data can also be accessible to pure qual
                      researchers.</q> Let's be honest --they continue-- <q>Since the 1960s qual methods remain more or less the same.
                      It is not an issue per se but the consumer has changed. Digital runs the world, yet <strong>qualitative researchers still
                        mainly rely on
                        face to face interviews</strong> and focus groups to understand these changes. The last MR industry report clearly stated
                      that online
                      methods barely broke through. They only represent a very small share of global qual revenue.</q>. 2 elements explained this
                    issue --they state--: <q>The education background of qual researchers; literature or humanities, makes them trust their brain
                      more than digital tools. On the other hand, we can admit that some digital tools are a bit over promising, and less efficient
                      than a qual researcher's brain when it comes to sentiment analysis, for instance!
                      Qual researchers need to meet the respondents, in flesh and blood, to understand them in depth and It is true that an online
                      solution may shade the non-verbal expression, which is an important part to get a full portray of the respondent.
                    </q>
                  </p>
          
                  
                  <h2>Why should qual researchers be interested in web navigation data?</h2>
                  <p>
                    I disagree with the answer provided by <q>R</q> to this interesting question. They argued: 
                  </p>
                  <q>
                    With web navigation data, on an individual level, we know who they are (through basic socio demographics data or via a
                    segmentation), and we know what they do online.
                  </q>
                  <p>
                    I disagree, at least partially. I think navigation data, as long as social and cultural information, should not be neither overestimated or underestimated: the true true in
                    marketing researching is that segmentation and socio-cultural information --and not just a <q>basic</q> piece of information--- are a key component and without that, data become
                    worthless. So, what we should really assume is that <strong>navigation behavior is a part of a life style</strong>. I don't even
                    buy the idea that qualitative researcher must be interested in navigation data. I would go beyond that: I think qualitative (not
                    <q>quali</q>) research can enrich navigation data interpretation: a thorough observation of some selected samples from those
                    billions of inputs could catch some insights, that would remain invisible for data scientists (sometimes, data scientists could
                    be naive on human choices) </p>
                  <p>
                    The questions to be solved with these data focus on the following formula: <em>why persons in the segment <var>x</var> plunge into
                      <var>y</var> website, for as long as <var>z</var> ? ... and is there a pattern? </em> (that's the mathematical part that data scientist
                      could construct). And that is the punchy thing about navigation tracking.
                  </p>
          
                  <h2>How to visualize the navigation record of a consumer?</h2>
                  <p>
                    The most remarkable thing <q>R</q> did with these study was the solution about how to deploy the catched data. Basically, they
                    work with a sophisticated version of what we call snapshots:
                  </p>
                  <q>
                    We have implemented a small software solution that allows us to backtrack all the visited URLs <strong>one hour before or/ and after a
                      given event</strong>. It takes as an input the dedicated event (to have visited a specific URL, to have purchased a product within a
                    category) and delivers stories/monographs: a slideshow made of the screenshots of all the visited websites.
                  </q>
          
                  <p>
                    Data tracking at a massive scale, wth data scientists and the so, is not at odds with hard qualitative research. For example: they
                    could track 2000 people, and then select small groups to be interviewed or visited by ethnographers, and solve key
                    questions with an integration between quantitative and qualitative data.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In fact, <q>R</q> say: <q> the objective here is to <strong>understand the link that the consumer holds in his mind between two (types of)
                      websites</strong> or webpages that are apparently completely different from each other (...) Here, the qual researcher should pay
                      attention to content: even if it is on the same website, how does the content of each page change? Is it possible to identify a
                      common logic out of these changes?</q>
                  </p>
                  <h2>An illustrative example</h2>
                  <q>This data, sometimes really far from the topic investigated, helps the qual researcher to understand the underlying logic. For
                    instance, we studied the use of car sharing services in France and in the UK.
                    Below is one example of a young woman from the UK where her navigation before the visits of car sharing services is really
                    insightful. She wants to give her furniture to charity so she visits a lot of associations' websites where she could do so. Then
                    she realizes that she has to go from Aberdeen to Huddersfield, so she considers various means of transportation, and also car
                    sharing services.
                    It seems certain that using car sharing services is, for her, linked to the idea of collaborative economy. It goes in the same
                    direction as giving one's furniture to charity. It is an ideological support of car sharing services. It is not the only reason
                    to use this kind of service of course, some logics of support are far more utilitarian, and it is also possible to detect those
                    by analysing online journeys.</q>
                    <p>
                      But was she really understood?
                    </p>
          
                  <div id="insight" class="bannerTwitero">
                    <p>
                      Web navigation data can be used on an individual level and can be combined with other methods. Web navigation data is not only a
                      matter of big data. It is useful to
                      understand one person, because it is passive data, spontaneously produced by the respondent, without any bias. As such it is
                      sometimes very insightful, especially when it comes to topics that are intimate, or that are difficult to put words on.
