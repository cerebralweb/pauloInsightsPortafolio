              <p> It was the first time that I got in Pepe Ganga thinking like a father. I  shamelessly affirm that in the past
                I used to take advantage of my walks through the shopping center to enter to that place just to see toys; me
                weakness were always the transformers. Now the reason to enter was Bernardo, and I was heading
                directly to the newborns section. By looking at the labels and details of
                each product, I began to think as an ethnographer - and marketer, and then a vision
                materialized: many visits, statistics, interviews, and this article </p>
              <p> On one of those visits I scribbled the following list of topics to cover in my field journal:
              </p>
              
              <h2 id="problem"> The problem </h2>
              <p> How to sell a generation of parents concerned about safety? (In this text
                we analyze
                possible gaps in baby brands.) For that purpose we follow a hybrid method. </p>
              
            
              
              <h2> Steps followed in the investigation </h2>
              <p> After a couple of dizzying visits as an incognito buyer, I decided to interview some people.
                Finally
                I chose a woman, I explained my profession and the benefits of agreeing to be
                interviewed. </p>
              
              
              <ul>
                <li> We build a case following qualitative techniques. We develop two interviews
                  <em> Ana </em>, a 36-year-old woman, married, heterosexual, mother of a son, by profession an Engineer of
                  software, with a master's degree
                  in neural networks. Ana lives in Bogotá in a stratum 4 apartment (she is still paying for it), and is
                  a contractor of a public company (complements its
                  income as an hourly professor at a capital university). The first interview was structured
                  (for the panel integration process),
                  then two interviews were carried out, in two-hour sessions
                </li>
                <li> Second, we investigate international safety standards for baby products.
                </li>
                <li> Then we analyze <strong> statistics </strong> to establish the economic and demographic of this
                  market. </li>
                <li> Finally, we propose an anthropological investigation about the baby concepts that are used in
                  our societies; we try to understand
                  where do those concepts come from and how are they used today. </li>
              </ul>
              
              
              
              <h2 id="standards"> International standards </h2>
              
              <p> In this section we discuss 1) some standards and procedures for babies established by <a
                  href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/infant-and-toddler-health/basics/infant-and-toddler-health/hlv-20049400"
                  target="_ blank"> the Mayo Clinic </a>; 2) rules and <a
                  href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Safety-Education/Safety-Education-Centers/cribs"> standards
                  officers </a> in the United States (Commission for the Safety of Consumer Products); 3)
                standards
                promoted by brands like Johnson & Johnson and Vicks in baby safety, through <a
                  href="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/baby/Pages/default.aspx"> Healthy
                  Children </a>; 4) <a href="https://medlineplus.gov/infantandnewborncare.html"> Medline policies
                  Plus </a>, organization of the United States National Library of Medicine; 5 we analyze what
                we can learn from these
                standards in Latin America? 6) Finally, we elaborate some <strong> netnography </strong> insights,
                based on the analysis of the following visual material: </p>           
              
        
              <p> In this part of the analysis we paid special attention to the following topics: </p>
              <ul>
                <li> Use of the corral in everyday life </li>
                <li> Staging of the corral as an important object in the construction of family memories. </li>
                <li> We value: why reviews in English can influence the Latin consumer of the middle and upper classes?
                </li>
              </ul>
              
              
              <h2 id="story"> Get a true story: ("Ana") </h2>
              <p>
                Ana always wanted to be a mother: she almost did not succeed. The obstacles were not medical, nor sentimental;
                personally,
                I think the stress and movements that her professional career forced her prolonged the wait
                more than
                wanted.
                When reading the transcripts of our interviews, it seems to me that Ana is a typical case : in her
                experience we discovered
                that complex processes - apparently disconnected from motherhood - have an impact on decisions
                of
                <span id="insight"> consumption </span>.
              </p>
              
              <div class="bannerTwitero">
                <h2> Insight </h2>
                <p>
                  Bium: the brand is <em> more for less </em>. The Bium pens in the segment are very competitive because
                  They are outstanding in two aspects: price and safety (key element in the value proposition in the
                  segment of
                  baby products).
                </p>
              
              
              </div>
              <h2> Family </h2>
              <p> Ana was the first daughter of a more or less traditional marriage. Her mother did college,
                but
                did not complete them; her father, on the other hand, perfectly served as provider man and leader of the.
                House,
                thanks to her practice as a chemical engineer. </p>
              <p> As the oldest of three siblings Ana felt inclined to be a meticulous student and to <q> follow the
                  steps of her father </q>.
                A software engineer created computer programs and had to master ("later I discovered that the one I was looking to
                please was myself, not my dad", she concluded in one
                of
                the sections of the interview). </p>
              <p> It is not a secret that in Latin America engineering has always been considered <em> a trade for
                  men </em>.
                This brings me to my second consideration. </p>
              <h2> Gender </h2>
              <p> "I didn't want to be like my mom". When I asked Ana about the meaning of this phrase, she hesitated, and on her face
                she showed
                a grimace of shame. I insisted. I asked about the truncated profession of her mother (Law), about the age to
                she abandoned (19), what the causes were (the marriage with her father), and the consequences.
                Silence. </p>           

              
              
              <p> One last question occurred to me. <q>Are you mad at your mother?</q> --I said. I dont know. I ventured a
                Hypothesis: <q>Maybe that had to do with your vocational choice</q> - I suggested, but I got no answer. </p>
              
              <p> It seemed clear to me that <strong>Ana's consumption decisions had profoundly influenced her
                  familiar history </strong>
                (<dfn> Some psychologists refer in this way to family conflicts that inevitably
                  we all drag.) </dfn> </p>
              <p> The key here is how to interpret the archetype behind Ana's decisions. Briefly: being an engineer was
                her way of
                handling various <q> family ills </q>, including the drama usually suffered by older children
                (fill father's shoes) and looks like mother (daughters' case) without being <em> too much </em> alike.
              </p>
              
              <p> What decisions did Ana make in this context? Fundamentally one: putting off motherhood to focus
                completely in her professional career. She did a postgraduate degree in Spain (in cutting-edge technology -
                neural networks - which makes computers <q> smarter </q>, she married another engineer of
                software,
              
                and tried to get a job at a multinational company. </p>
              <p> In other words, Ana decided to make <strong> a safe life route </strong>. All Ana's decisions
                are marked by this search for the safe (for example, it was safe to look like their father and insecure
                become a housewife, like her mother) </p>
              <p> <strong> The need for insurance also affects consumption decisions. </strong> And with this
                information that
                we can
                analyze the relationship of an Ana as mom with <strong> the purchase of baby accessories. </strong> </p>
              
              
              <h2 id="C3"> Behavioral interpretation </h2>
              
              <p> The baby aftermarket is juicier than ever.
                Birth rates in almost all Latin American countries are rising. People like Ana want to buy.
                But
                I know
                It deals with people extremely concerned about security. Ana - the case with we accompany this
                research - have the ability to quickly know and understand the
                baby safety information (for example, from American standards
                ). </a> </p>
              <p> In addition to the diet of information and concern for safety, let's remember the weight of certain
                archetypes of family novels (which would not be unusual to see repeated over and over again in thousands of
                consumers.)
              </p>
              
              <div class="bannerTwitero">
                <h2>A Behavioral interpretation of "safe" products </h2>
                <p> Four factors (birth rate, higher educational levels, ability to access and interpret the
                  information and family archetypes) allow <strong> to understand Ana's consumption decision </strong> in the
                  moment
                  of buying a playpen for your baby: do not choose the most expensive, nor the largest, nor the most
                  decorated, nor the one
                  have
                  more accessories: choose the safest according to international safety standards </a> </p>
                <p> <strong> It is not a lack of budget </strong>: it is a complex security concern. </p>
