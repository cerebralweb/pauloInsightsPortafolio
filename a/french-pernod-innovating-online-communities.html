                <p><em><span style="color: rgb(248, 156, 8);">In this article ❧ </span>This is a recap of a research
                    developed by the French brand Pernod Ricard in Latin America, focused on
                    lifestyles and trends in the consumption of distilled drinks. They used an online communitie to
                    analyze women who consume liquor in private
                    situations. This is based on a ESOMAR report (see the footnote) </em></p>

            <div class="publicidadEnArticulo" id="oculto_publicidadEnArticulo">
            </div>
            <script src="/js/us-publicidadEnArticulo.js"></script>

            <p><strong>Women love wine, men love beer.</strong> That's true on me and false for many women I know to whom wine and
                beer are at the same level. Of course,
                drinking alcohol is a way of taking off, take over inhibited behavior, so it doesn't make sense to try to talk about
                that as beer and wine, for example, were at odds each other.
                Maybe Pernod Ricard believed the first --women prefer wine-- so they did this.
              </p>
              
              <p>I think the ESOMAR report that I used for this article starts with a clever and simple idea: </p>
              
              <q> <dfn>One of the main challenges in the liquor industry is to achieve a real understanding of the consumers' needs.
                  The consumption
                  occasions <strong>take place a in private context</strong> where traditional techniques of research do not achieve
                  to be suitable to deep
                  understand needs, barriers and drivers of consumption towards the liquor category</dfn>.</q>
              
              <p>But why I am interested in: to tell you the true, Hexis is developing its own framework for developing online
                communities: as simple as that.</p>
              
              <h2>Private Life and Consumption</h2>
              <p>Now, there is another reason, to be honest. I turns out that I have a HUUUGE curiosity about private situations and
                its impact
                on comsumption habits, and it seems that <strong>online communities are an effective way to understand consumptions
                  that take place in private</strong> spheres (toilet paper or wine, for example). The authors pointed this too: </p>
              <q>So, in consideration of how to enter our consumers lives, without being intrusive, we created an online community
                (OC) where
                consumers came to us. This OC generated useful information not only through set activities but also through
                experiences.
                Panelists had the opportunity to share and recommend places, drinks, tastes and more.</q>
              
              <ul>
                <h2>2 things online communities are for</h2>
                <li>They leverage the power of ethnography</li>
                <li>and allow to develop deep co-creation delopment</li>
              </ul>
              
              <h2> Segmentation </h2>
              
              <p>
                Online communities allow to perform detailed, but also clever, segmentation. You can see the evolution of the
                community and, as you go,
                modify the segmentation. This is kind of obvious in the following description: <q>we decided to target women that
                  mainly like to
                  go to trendy places and are willing to learn new things. Also, <strong>women who like to party, who drink
                    alcohol</strong> regularly, and who pay
                  close attention to their appearance</q>. Why would they do that? Because, online communities allow it. Think just on
                this:
                <q>women who like to party, who drink alcohol regularly</q>. Which woman is going to admit that in front of someone
                else: pardon,
                but Latin Americans are already so conservative to even admit that a woman could make decisions on public (am I
                overreacting? )
              </p>

              <div class="popup" onclick="myFunction()">

                // When the user clicks on <div>, open the popup
                function myFunction() {
                  var popup = document.getElementById("myPopup");
                  popup.classList.toggle("show");
                }
              </script>
              
              
              <h2>Rewards and Behavioral Economics</h2>
              <p>
                Let's see how did they handle the motivation in the community participants:
              </p>
              <q>
                The incentive plan was designed following theoretical basis of token economy. A token economy is a system of
                contingency
                management based on the <strong>systematic reinforcement</strong> of target behavior. The reinforcers are symbols or
                "tokens" that can be exchanged
                for other reinforcers. A token economy is based on the principles of operant conditioning and <strong>behavioral
                  economics</strong> and can be
                situated within applied behavior analysis. The aim of token economy is an increase probability of occurrence of a
                specific
                behavior.
              </q>
              <p>
                They considered, first, <q>Items aligned with the common topic (fashion, accessories, liquor, healthy plan, esthetic
                  plan,
                  etc.)</q>, then other mainstream and premium items and, finally, the interaction between virtual money and points
                according to
                type of activities and level of difficulty. So, they settled the following system:
              </p>
              <q>
                <strong>Every activity had an amount of virtual points</strong> assigned. According to the quality of the
                participation a certain amount of points
                was granted to users. For example, in a diary activity they could win 200 points per participation. If the user
                answered all the
                questions and shared videos and/or photos, she would gain 200 points. On the contrary, if the participant did not give
                much
                detail, it was most likely that she would obtain only 50 points.
              </q>
              <p>
                The researchers discover something that we can quite attribute to what economist called <q> marginal utility</q>.
                Lets'
                see: <q>We noticed that the participants who claimed prices after winning some points, as opposed to those who waited
                  until the
                  end, were more motivated to continue completing activities. The fact that they received a prize keeps them wanting
                  more.</q>.
                In a nutshell,<strong> marginal utility</strong> happends when <dfn>the first unit of consumption of a good yields
                  more utility than the second,
                  and the so</dfn>. In this case, I guess, participants getting prizes since the beginning needed at least the same
                dosis, so to speak, to feel
                satisfaction as participants, so they were more prone to engaged in activities, whereas participants that weren't
                getting prized since the
                beginning showed less interest (since <strong>they feel great pleasure just with one prize</strong> ).
              </p>
              <p>
                This is definitely an interesting issue. I remember many times --holding the position of Online community moderator--
                thinking about people
                participation as something really irregular. <strong>Sometimes one can see a person participating a lot but
                  copypasting repeated things</strong> over and over again; and the
                oppsite. So, I guess something in the middle (not to much, not too absent) is just good.
              </p>

              <h2>On Community Manangers</h2>
                  <p>A Community Mananger moderates online communities, meaning by that: management of routine activities, daily talks to
                    participants,
                    solving participation issues, contacting participants, and sometimes interacting in fun (or <strong>at least
                      polite</strong> ) ways. In some cases, they
                    are told to take part in analysis teams, during the post-community (some of them used to be anthropologists).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Of course, it is not a task easy to perform. Here you have some problems reported in this Esomar paper:
                  </p>
                  
                  <ul>
                    <h2>Community managers common mistakes</h2>
                    <li>Not knowing how your platform works on the different devices</li>
                    <li>Abuse from the private communication channels with participants (WhatsApp)</li>
                    <li>Copy and paste the information for all participants</li>
                    <li>Publishing without testing</li>
                    <li>Over-posting and Ignored participants' comments and questions</li>
                    <li>Lack of flexibility in service hours</li>
                    <li><strong>Do your know that most ot the time Community Manangers are women ? But Why?</strong></li>
                  
                  
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p>
                    You see? There is a lot of responsibility on the Community managers; they expect a 24 hours compromise,
                    as you can see in this excerpt: <q>During our research, we found out that the best time to contact the panelists was
                      either <strong>at
                        night or on a Sunday</strong> afternoon. Most of our participants were either full-time students or full-time
                      employees. For this reason,
                      it was not possible for us to set limited service hours. It was necessary to carry the follow up of the participants
                      on our
                      phones, and answer when they had the time to contact us.An important fact of the CM is to always have personalized
                      communication with users (...) Developing
                      personalization is not only changing a name in the email, it is creating a different relation with each
                      participant.</q>. I' d add that
                    is also important that the community platform being used provides the technological means that make nicer a job that
                    could be kind of
                    difficult at some momentos.
                  </p>

                        One of the key success factors to build online communities is to find common topics of interest, where
                        participants
                        not only carry
                        out activities and respond to questions, but their interactions are generally focused on a specific topic area,
                        building a space
                        of interaction, attractive, fun and versatile to generate ideas and share experiences.
