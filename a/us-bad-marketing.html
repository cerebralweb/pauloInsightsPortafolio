                <p> I AM ALMOST ALWAYS looking for recipes for success. I don't care why I do it: what matters to me is whether
                    they work or not. I learned one of
                    those recipes in a classic marketing book, and I've listened, seen and acted it so many times that it
                    feel weariness and restlessness about. It is a shame, because it contains an essential truth about why we buy things.
                    I'm talking about the
                    idea that a brand must be <q>unique</q>, or that its products must be <q>unique</q>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I'm not sure what it means to be unique, or if there is something unique somewhere. However, I am clear that any
                    seller who
                    has passed through a marketing course is always looking for <q> something that makes unique his product </q>.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    I'm 35 years old and I have no
                    hair anymore. Also I have a PhD. with emphasis on <q> anthropology of consumption </q> (another recipe). I mentioned
                    this
                  
                    precisely because of these two inescapable realities I ended up meeting a Venezuelan hairdresser who --without
                    know it-- confirmed that there are Marketing recipes that end in small disasters.

                    <li> It is not actionable knowledge. </li>
                    <li> Isolates you from your client. </li>
                    <li> You replace knowledge of customer needs with a nonsensical speech. </li>
                    <li> You forget that being unique, or having the right price, or creating the optimal distribution channels are not

                  <p>
                    With apparent resignation I resumed my fieldwork, which consisted of investigating
                    health representations and
                    beauty in the segment of men who are young adults (between 22 to 39 years old). A brand of
                    products of
                    personal hygiene wanted supplies to develop an advertising campaign that would be deployed mainly in
                    Transmilenio. The campaign - so they have planned, but I do not know if they will achieve it - will use a
                    mobile video game
                    based on augmented reality, just as it did <a

                    Two tasks were entrusted to me. <strong> I had to manage an online community </strong> and develop a
                    ethnographic research in a
                    Bogota shopping center. I organized myself, then, as follows: the <a
                      href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFV71QPvX2I">
                      cycle of activities </a> in the online community would be
                    daily - since
                    its duration would be five days--; with the same rhythm I would do the ethnographies. Solution: in the morning
                    online community,
                    in the afternoon shopping center.
                  </p>
                  <h2> July 17 </h2>
                  <p>
                    Ethnographic work at a mall. The plan was to pose as a client and hold talks with hairdressers and
                    customers,
                    recruit some people for in-depth interviews and take pictures. About the results of that day
                    I will not say anything else.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                    I'm just going to talk about my own haircut, as I actually had to pay for one to have the complete experience;
                    And so I was able to verify, once again, that there are marketing recipes that end in small disasters.
                  
                    In the first salon there were 2 teenagers: I was not going to cut my hair with a teenager; in the
                    second
                    there were four hairdressers, some of them sitting on the floor with an expression that conveyed that they hadn't won
                    a
                    penny during the whole day: I didn't want what others didn't want; in the third one, some kind old women attended: I
                    like them
                    and I even agreed to interview one of them, but I don't cut my hair with old women; in the fourth, a man in his 25s,
                    dress like a hipster, received me:
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p> - How much a haircut ... for me? </p>
                  <p> - Come in, come in. </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                    The man refused to answer my simple question and respectfully ordered me to go to the counter. As he saw that I
                    was - timidly - going to refuse following him, he turned around and started walking. I looked up the whole room with
                    an annoyed face;
                    I felt like my dad was going to give a sermon (at the same time, I saw that the manicurist was very attentive to my
                    facial reactions).
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>
                    On the counter:
                  
                  </p>
                  <p> - Is the haircut for you? </p>
                  <p> - No. --I said, to bother him. </p>
                  <p>
                    - We are an ornamental aesthetic center. So we don't say that we are hairdressers: we are artists,
                    we make
                    style aesthetics (sic). Because we also have a recognized stylist in the country.
                  </p>
                  <p> - You?
                  </p>
                  <p> - No. It's Jaime, Jaime Hernandez. But he is on leave. </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong> - What sets us apart is that (...) we are not hairdressers </strong>, like the rest of beauty saloons you can
                    find here [in that mall]. You live
                    here [in the neighborhood]?
                  </p>
                  <p> - Yes. </p>
                  <p> - Because we have been here for fourteen years. </p>
                  
                  <p>
                    Only at the end of the conversation he did answer my question. The cut was worth forty thousand pesos, and included
                    blah, blah,
                    blah.
                    I escaped as fast I could.
                  
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                    Almost next door was a barber shop. The Venezuelan who attended it was
                    attending a
                    client, and while he was finishing he answered my question correctly: twenty thousand (the haircut cost). I entered
                    with pleasure,
                    I sat down, I waited; and
                    I received an excellent haircut. At some point in the conversation Oscar told me - and he let me record his voice
                    while he was
                    telling me--
                    that several clients of the "Center for Ornamental Aesthetics" had gone to his barber shop. I wasn't surprised:
                    <strong>
                      price, promotion and product </strong>
                    were properly aligned, with no evidence that the marketing jargon had some influence
                    <span id="insight"></span>
                    there (the invisible hand: I imagined Smith spanking Marx).
                  </p>

                    In summary. The first beauty saloon people <strong> recited what they had learned in some marketing course, but his
                      proposal of
                      value was poorly exposed and poorly valued. </strong> Those of the Venezuelan hairdresser, however, did not appeal
                    to that jargon, but in their way he was acting as the most effective marketer: <strong> the one that produces a
                      harmonious relationship
                      between
                      value promise and customer expectation </strong>. The first ones do not show valid or
                    practical knowledge of the
                    segment (middle class, and Millenial, men and women); the others, with their intuitive knowledge of the segment,
                    achieved
                  
                    solutions that better answer questions such as the following: How do people who frequent
                    this mall understand "Aesthetics", "masculinity", fashion? What a haircut is? Hygiene, fashion, "personality"? How
                    much are they
                    ready
                    to pay off?

                    By making a documentary comparison of their business cards I confirmed my interpretation. The card of the
                    "Center
                    of ornamental aesthetics promises me an "Artistic Director" (if I wanted art I would go to a gallery); The
                    Barber
                    Shop business card calls me "Official Customer" and
                    delivered value on the card itself, or at least made me believe that (on the back of the card there are ten
                    boxes where the cashier puts her signature on, and then says: "the tenth haircut on behalf of the house").
                  </p>

                    I, an anthropomercadologist, offer my services to Hexis without differentiating me from others like me. What sets me
                    apart
                    is that once in while I tell my bosses that nothing sets me apart. (I imagined Marx spanking
                    Smith).
