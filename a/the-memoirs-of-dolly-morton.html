        <H2>EDITOR'S NOTE:</H2>
        <p> The writer of this story has told me that the woman in question actually related the narrative
          as set forth herein, and that he believes it to be true in all main points. 5</p>

          <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <p> How I made the acquaintance of Dolly Morton, with a faithful account of the circumstances under
          which she felt impelled to tell me the story of her life. In the summer of the year 1866, shortly after the
          conclusion of the civil war between the North and South in America, I was in New York, to which city I had
          gone for the purpose of taking my passage in a Cunard Steamer to Liverpool on my way back home to one of the
          midland counties of England after a shooting and fishing trip in the province of Nova Scotia. My age at that
          period was thirty years, I stood six feet in my socks and I was strong and healthy, my disposition was
          adventurous; I was fond of women and rather reckless in my pursuit of them; so, during my stay in New York, I
          went about the city very much at night, seeing many queer sights and also various strange phases of life in
          the tenement houses. However, I do not intend to relate my experiences in the slums of New York City. One
          afternoon, about five o'clock, I had strolled into Central Park, where I seated myself on a bench under the
          shade of a tree to smoke r, cigar. It was a beautiful day in August; the sun, sloping to the west, was shining
          brightly in a cloudless sky; a light breeze was blowing, tempering the heat and making the leaves of the trees
          rustle with a soothing sound, and I leant lazily back in my seat, looking at the trim and often pretty
          nursemaids of various nationalities in charge of the smartly-dressed American children. Then my eyes turned
          upon a lady who was sitting on the adjoining bench, reading a book. She apparently was twenty-five years of
          age, a very pretty little woman with, as far as I could see, a shapely, well-rounded figure. Her hair was a
          light golden brown and was coiled in a big chignon at the back of her head-it was the day of chignons and
          crinolines. She was neatly gloved and handsomely but quietly dressed, everything she wore being in good taste,
          from the little hat on her head to the neat 6</p>

        <p>boots on her small, well-shaped feet, which peeped from under the hem of her wide skirt. I stared at her
          harder than was polite, thinking that she was quite the type of a pretty American lady of the upper class.
          After a moment or two she became conscious of my fixed gaze, and, raising her eyes from her book, she looked
          steadily at me for a short time. Then, apparently satisfied with my appearance, a bright smile came to her
          face and she shot a saucy glance at me, at the same time making a motion with her hand inviting me to come and
          sit beside her. I was rather astonished, as I had not thought from her appearance that she was one of the
          demi-monde; but I was quite willing to have a chat with her-and also to poke her, if her conversation pleased
          me as much as her looks. Rising from my seat, I went over to her, and she at once drew aside her voluminous
          skirts so as to make room for me on the bench beside her. I seated myself and we began to talk. She spoke
          grammatically and in an educated manner, and, though she had the American accent, her voice was low and
          musical-(I do not dislike the American accent when I hear it on the lips of a pretty woman)-and she certainly
          was a pretty woman. Her eyes were large, clear and blue, her complexion was extremely good, her teeth were
          white and regular, her nose was well-shaped and she had a small mouth with red lips. She had plenty to say for
          herself, chatting away merrily and using quaint expressions that made me laugh. I took quite a fancy to the
          lively little woman, so I made up my mind to see her home and spend the night with her. She had at once
          noticed by my accent that I was an Englishman, and she informed me that she never before had spoken to a man
          of my nationality. After we had chatted for some time, I asked her to dine 7</p>

        <p>with me. She seemed pleased at my invitation, and at once accepted it so we strolled quietly out of the park
          to a restaurant where I ordered a good dinner with champagne. When the meal was over and I had smoked a cigar,
          I took my companion, who told me that her name was &quot;Dolly,&quot; to a theatre. At the end of the
          performance I engaged a &quot;hack,&quot; as the conveyance is called in New York, and drove the woman to her
          home, which was in the suburbs, about three miles from the theatre. Since it was a bright, moonlit night, I
          was able to see that the house was a pretty little onestoried building with a creeper-covered veranda standing
          in a small garden surrounded by iron railings. The door was opened by a neatly-dressed quadroon woman who
          ushered us into the drawing room; then, after drawing the curtains and turning up the gas jets in the
          gasoliers, she went away. The room, which had folding doors at one end, was prettily furnished; there was
          nothing in the least suggestive about it, everything being in good style. The floor was covered with a
          handsome Oriental carpet, the curtains were velvet; there were some good engravings on the walls, and there
          was a cabinet containing some choice specimens of old china. My companion told me to sit down and make myself
          comfortable; then, begging me to excuse her for a moment or two, she passed through the folding doors into the
          adjoining apartment, which I saw was a bedroom. In a short time she returned, dressed in a white wrapper
          trimmed with blue ribbons; she had taken off her boots and put on dainty little French slippers, and her hair
          was flowing loose over her shoulders nearly down to her waist. She looked so &quot;fetching&quot; that I at
          once took her on my knees and gave her a kiss on the lips, which she returned, at the same time inserting the
          tip of her tongue in my mouth. Then I put my hand up her clothes, finding that she had nothing on under the
          wrapper but a fine, lace- 8</p>

        <p>trimmed chemise and her black silk stockings, which were fastened high above the knees with scarlet satin
          garters, so I was able to feel her whole body with perfect ease. She was plump as a partridge; there was not a
          single angle about her figure, and her skin was as smooth as satin. Her bubbies were rather small, but they
          were as round as apples, quite firm and tipped with tiny, erect, pink nipples. She had a very good bottom with
          plump firm cheeks, and the hair on the Mons Veneris was silky to the touch. She gave me a brandy and soda, and
          we chatted while I smoked a cigar. Then we went into the bedroom, where everything was exquisitely clean and
          sweet. In a short time we were between the sheets. My breast was on her bosom, my mouth was on her lips, my
          amatory organ was up to the roots in her den of love, my hands were grasping the cheeks of her bottom and I
          was riding her vigorously, while she was sighing, squeaking and bucking up under my powerful digs. My member
          was big, her fissure was small and wonderfully tight; moreover she was a good mount, so I enjoyed the
          &quot;flutter&quot; very much, especially as I had not &quot;had&quot; a woman for a month. But I had knocked
          all the breath out of the little woman, and, when all was over, she lay panting in my arms. However, when she
          had recovered her wind, she said with a little laugh: &quot;My gracious! You are very big and very strong. I
          don't think I've ever had such a vigorous embrace in all my life. You seemed to go right through me. But I
          like it.&quot; I laughed, making no remark, but lying quietly resting, still holding her in my arms and
          stroking her cool velvety skin till I was ready for action again. Then, making her kneel on all fours outside
          the bed, I poked her from behind, &quot;en leverette&quot; again making her wince and squeak and wriggle her
          bottom. We then got between the sheets again, and I made her lie on her side with her back turned towards me 9
        </p>

        <p>while I lay behind her with my belly and thighs pressed against the cool, plump cheeks of her bottom and with
          my half-stiff tool resting in the cleft of her thighs. In this position we fell asleep. I slept soundly, not
          waking once till half-past eight o'clock next morning. Sitting up in the bed, I looked at my companion, who
          was still fast asleep, lying on her back with her long hair streaming over the pillow and her arms stretched
          above her head. She looked quite young and very pretty and there was a faint pink tint on her round cheeks. I
          gently pulled the bed-clothes down to her feet and rolled up her night dress to her chin without waking her.
          Then I took a good look at her naked charms. And they were worth looking at. Her skin was as white as milk and
          without a blemish; she really was very well-made, and perfectly proportioned.- Her little bubbies stood out
          from her bosom in high relief; her plump, well-rounded thighs were shapely; she had good legs; her ankles were
          slender; her belly was without a wrinkle-she evidently had never had a child-and her rose-bed was shaded with
          fine, curly, golden hair. My pintle was as stiff as a poker, so I woke her by gently tickling the edge of her
          grotto with my forefinger. She looked smilingly up in my face, her big blue eyes twinkling with fun, saying:
          &quot;So you have prepared me for the morning sacrifice. Well, I am ready to receive the stroke.&quot; She
          then stretched out her legs and in a few seconds I had given her a strong morning poke, which pleased me more
          than the ones I had had overnight, for, while I was working at her, the little woman had bucked up more
          briskly and had wriggled her bottom in the spasm even more lasciviously than on the two other occasions. She
          really seemed to like the digging I gave her, and I don't think she had pretended to be voluptuously excited
          merely to please me. 10</p>

        <p>Presently we began to chat on various subjects, her conversation showing that she took an intelligent
          interest in the affairs of the day. Our talk eventually turned to what was at that period a burning topic, the
          late civil war, and I asked her which side had had her sympathies. &quot;I am a Northern woman,&quot; she
          replied, &quot;so I was always for the Union, and am exceedingly glad that the Southerners were beaten and the
          slaves set free. Slavery was a horrible thing and a disgrace to the country.&quot; &quot;But,&quot; I said,
          &quot;from all the accounts one hears, it seems that the Negroes in the South were better off before the war
          as slaves than they are now as free people.&quot; &quot;Oh, but they are free now, and that is the great
          point. No doubt things are bad at present, but they will improve in time.&quot; &quot;I thought that, as a
          rule, the slaves were well-treated by their owners.&quot; &quot;So they were in many cases,&quot; she replied,
          &quot;but there was no security for them; there was always the chance of their being sold to strange people;
          and then wives were separated from their husbands, and children from their parents. Besides, there were many
          owners who treated their slaves badly-working them hard, feeding them scantily and whipping them cruelly for
          the least offence. Then again, slaves had no rights of any sort. The girls and women, if light coloured and
          pretty, were not allowed to be virtuous, even if they wished to be. They were obliged to give themselves up to
          the embraces of their masters, and, if a woman dared to object, she was severely whipped.&quot; Oh, surely you
          must be mistaken,&quot; I observed. &quot;No, I am not. I know what I am talking about, for I lived in a slave
          state before the war, and I had special opportunities for finding out all about slavery and the distressing
          things connected with it.&quot; &quot;Was it a common thing for women to be whipped?&quot; I asked. 11</p>

        <p>&quot;Yes; I do not suppose that there was a single plantation in the whole of the South where the female
          slaves were not whipped. Of course, on some plantations there was more whipping than on others. And what made
          the thing more horrid was the fact that the whippings were always inflicted by men, and very often in the most
          public way.&quot; &quot;On what part of the body were the slave women whipped; and what instruments of
          punishment were used?&quot; I inquired. &quot;Sometimes they were whipped on the back, but most frequently on
          the bottom; the instruments used were various; there was the hickory switch, the strap and the paddle.&quot;
          &quot;What is the paddle?&quot; &quot;It is a round flat piece of wood fixed to a long handle, and it was
          always used on the bottom. It does not draw blood, but each stroke raises a blister on the skin and bruises
          the flesh. The hickory switch, if used with any degree of force, will cut the skin and draw blood. There was
          another terrible instrument of punishment called 'the cowhide,' but it was very seldom used on women.&quot;
          &quot;You seem to know all about whipping. Now tell me how it was you came to be living in a slave
          state,&quot; said I. &quot;I was helping to run a station on the 'underground railroad'; but I suppose you
          don't know what an 'underground station' is.&quot; &quot;No, I do not, what is it?&quot; &quot;'Underground
          railroad stations' were houses in which the abolitionists used to conceal the runaway slaves. There were a
          number of these 'stations' in various parts of the South, and the runaway was forwarded secretly by night from
          one 'station' to another, till he or she finally got to a free state. It was dangerous work, because assisting
          a slave to escape was against the laws of the South, and to do so was considered a 12</p>

        <p>very great crime. Any man or woman caught at such work was sure of getting a long term of imprisonment with
          hard labour in the State's prison. Besides, everyone's hand was against the abolitionist; not only the
          slave-owners, but also the ordinary white people who did not own a single slave, and it often happened that
          abolitionists were lynched. They were tarred and feathered, or ridden on a rail or made to suffer in some
          other way by bands of lawless men.&quot; &quot;Did you ever get into trouble while you were at the
          'underground station?'&quot; I asked. &quot;Yes I did. I got into bitter trouble, and went through dreadful
          sufferings. In fact, what happened to me changed the whole course of my life and was the cause of my being
          what I am now. Oh, how I hate the Southerners! The cruel wretches!&quot; she exclaimed fiercely, her eyes
          flashing, her bosom heaving and her cheeks reddening. I was surprised at her sudden outburst of anger, and it
          at once struck me that the little woman had a story. I was curious to hear it, so I said: &quot;I should very
          much like to hear what happened to you in the South. Will you tell me?&quot; After a moment's hesitation, she
          replied: &quot;I have never told my story to a man yet; but I will tell it to you, as you are an Englishman
          and I think you have a sympathetic nature. The story is a very long one, and there is not time to tell it to
          you now, but if you will come here tonight at seven o'clock and dine quietly with me, I will give you a full
          account of my life.&quot; I replied that I should be delighted to dine with her and that it would give me
          great pleasure to hear her story. Just then there was a knock at the door and the quadroon woman, neatly
          dressed and wearing a smart cap on her head, came into the room with tea and buttered toast on a tray, which
          she placed on a table beside the bed. 13</p>

        <p>My companion sat up, saying to the quadroon: &quot;Mary, give me my wrapper.&quot; The woman handed her
          mistress the garment, which she threw over her shoulders. Then turning to me, Dolly said with a smile:
          &quot;Mary was a slave for twenty-five years, and if you'd like to ask her any questions about her life she
          will answer you truthfully. She is not shy. Are you, Mary?&quot; The quadroon, who was a very buxom, rather
          good-looking woman, smiled broadly, showing a double row of white teeth between her full, red lips. &quot;No,
          Miss Dolly,&quot; she replied, &quot;I isn't shy.&quot; I was quite ready to ask Mary to give me some
          information about herself, so to begin with, I said: &quot;Well Mary, how old are you and what state do you
          come from?&quot; &quot;I'se thirty years old, Sah, an' I was raised on ole Major Bascombe's plantation in de
          state ob Alabama. Dere was one hundred an' fifty field hands on de plantation, an' twelve house servants in de
          place. I was one ob de parlour maids, Sah,&quot; she added with a sort of pride. &quot;Was your master a good
          one?&quot; I next asked the woman. &quot;Well, Sah, he was a pretty good Massa on de whole; he fed us well,
          an' he didn't work us too hard; but he was bery strict, an' dere was plenty ob whipping on de plantation, an'
          in de house too.&quot; &quot;Were you ever whipped?&quot; Mary looked at me with an expression of surprise on
          her face at being asked such a silly question. &quot;Ob course I was, Sah, many a time,&quot; she replied.
          &quot;I got my fust whippin' when I was 'bout seven years old, an' I got my las' one when I was twenty-five
          years old; only a week 'fore we was all set free by de President ob de United States.&quot; 14</p>

        <p>&quot;How were you whipped?&quot; &quot;When I was a little girl I used to get spanked; when I grew big, dey
          whipped me on de bare back or bottom wid de strap or de hick'ry switch; and I'se had de paddle on my bottom
          several times,&quot; said Mary, coolly as possible. &quot;Who used to whip the women?&quot; &quot;One ob de
          overseers gener'ly; but sometimes de Massa himself used to whip de house-servants, Dere was a room kep' for de
          purpose, an' when a gal or a woman was whipped, she was tied face downwards on a long bench, den her close was
          turned up an' she got her allowance.&quot; &quot;Were the whippings severe?&quot; &quot;Oh, dey always hurt us
          dreffully an' made us squeal out loud an' wriggle; an' sometimes we was whipped till the blood come.&quot;
          Here Dolly broke in, saying: &quot;And when the skin of a woman's back or bottom has been broken by a
          whipping, the marks never entirely disappear. Mary has plenty of marks upon her body at this moment. Show your
          bottom to the English gentleman, Mary, and prove the truth of what you have told him.&quot; The woman, without
          the least hesitation, turned her back towards me. Then she gathered all her clothes up under her arms,
          exposing the whole lower part of her person. (She was wearing no drawers.) It was a sight!! All women of Negro
          blood have, naturally, big bottoms, and, since Mary was rather stout, her bottom was enormous, the plump
          hemispheres of flesh swelling out and sweeping in great curves to the massive thighs and sturdy legs cased in
          tight, white cotton stockings. Her skin was smooth and of a light brown tint, and I noticed at once that both
          the fat cheeks of her bottom as well as the upper part of her thighs were marked with long, fine, white lines
          where the skin had been cut by the lash. 15</p>

        <p>She seemed to like showing her opulent charms, for she was in no hurry to drop her petticoats, but stood
          looking over her shoulder at me with a complacent smile on her face till her mistress said: &quot;That will
          do, Mary.&quot; She then let her clothes fall and left the room smiling. &quot;There,&quot; said Dolly,
          &quot;you have seen the marks on her bottom, and I can tell you that her back is just as much marked.
          Moreover, she was seduced, or, to speak more correctly, she had to give herself up to her master's eldest son
          when she was only fifteen years old. She afterwards passed through the hands of the two younger sons; but the
          fact of her being the plaything of the three young men did not save her bottom from being blistered by the
          paddle or striped with the switch whenever she committed an offence of any sort. She has told me that she
          sometimes had to go to the room of one or another of the young masters while her bottom was bleeding from a
          whipping. I have another woman about thirty-five years of age in my service as cook; she comes from South
          Carolina, and her body is even more scarred than Mary's with the marks of the whip.&quot; Dolly paused for a
          moment or two while she sipped her tea. Then she said: &quot;Now don't you think it is a good thing that
          slavery has been abolished in the United States?&quot; &quot;Yes, indeed I do. I had no idea that female
          slaves were ever treated in such a way,&quot; I replied. The details given me by Dolly and the quadroon had
          surprised me very much and had also somewhat moved me. But at the same time I was feeling very randy. The
          sight of a woman's bottom always has an exciting effect upon me. Therefore the full view I had just had of
          Mary's big posteriors had given me a tremendous cockstand. So, taking hold of Dolly, I kid her on her back,
          pulled down the bedclothes, tucked up her drapery and poked her again with great gusto. Then, after refreshing
          myself with a cup of tea and a piece of toast, I got up and had a cold bath in a small dressing room adjoining
          the bedchamber. 16</p>

        <p>As soon as I had dressed myself, I bade Dolly good bye, promising to be back again without fail at seven
          o'clock. Then, giving her a kiss and a good present, I left the house and made my way back to the hotel where
          I was staying. After changing my clothes I sat down to breakfast with a good appetite, feeling very well
          satisfied with my night's amusement. The day passed rather slowly, and sharply at seven o'clock I was back at
          Dolly's house, curious to hear her story and fully intending to stay with her all night again. She seemed glad
          to see me, and she was looking very nice in a pretty frock of some soft white material. She gave me a simple
          but well cooked little dinner, with a bottle of excellent Burgundy. Mary, smartly dressed and beaming with
          smiles- but perfectly respectful-waited on us, and, when the meal was over and we had gone into the drawing
          room, she brought some really well-made coffee. Dolly leant back in an easy chair with her feet, in smart
          velvet slippers, resting on a stool, and, since her skirts were slightly raised, I was able to see her trim
          ankles cased in pale blue silk stockings. I lit a cigar and settled myself in another easy chair opposite her.
          She then began to tell me her story, which turned out to be a very long one. The tale was not nearly finished
          when we went to bed after a little supper at midnight. But, having got interested in the narrative, I wished
          to hear the end of it, so I paid Dolly three or four more visits and she continued her story each time I saw
          her until, at last, she had related the whole of her adventures to me. Since I was able to write shorthand, I
          took down her narrative exactly as she related it, without a break, in her own words. 17</p>

          <h2>CHAPTER 1</h2>

        <p> A young girl's humiliating experiences, death of my father; how I made Miss Ruth Dean's
          acquaintance and what came of it; helping to free the slaves. My name is Dolly Morton, I am just twenty-six
          years of age and I was born in Philadelphia, where my father was a clerk in a bank. I was his only child and
          my mother died when I was two years old, so I have no remembrance of her. My father's salary was small, but he
          gave me as good an education as his means would allow, his intention being that I should gain my living as a
          school teacher. He was a silent, stern, reserved man, who perhaps may have been fond of me in his way: but he
          never showed any outward sign of affection, and he always kept me under strict discipline. Whenever I
          committed a fault, he would lay me across his knees, turn up my short petticoats, take down my drawers and
          spank me soundly with a broad piece of leather. I was a plump, soft, thin-skinned girl who felt pain acutely,
          and I used to shriek and kick up my heels and beg for mercy -which however, I never received, for he would
          calmly go on spanking me till my poor little bottom was as red as fire and I was hoarse with screaming. Then
          when the punishment was over and my trembling fingers had buttoned up my drawers, I would slink away with
          smarting bottom and streaming eyes &deg; our old servant who had been my nurse, and she would sympathize with
          me and comfort me till the smart of the spanking had passed off. Our life was a rather lonely one; we had no
          relatives, my father did not care for society of any sort and I had very few girl friends of my own age; but I
          was strong and healthy, my disposition was cheerful and, fortunately, I was fond of reading, so, though I
          often felt very dull, I was not absolutely unhappy as a child. And so the years rolled on, quietly and
          uneventfully. My childhood passed, I was eighteen years of age and had grown to my full height of five feet,
          four inches; my figure was well rounded, and I was quite a woman in appearance. I had begun to chafe at the
          monotony and 18</p>

        <p>repression of my life, and was sometimes very wilful and disobedient. But I always suffered on such
          occasions, for my father still continued to treat me as a child, taking me across his knees and spanking me
          whenever I offended him. Moreover, he informed me that he would spank me every time I misbehaved until I was
          twenty years old. This was very humiliating to a girl of my age, especially since I had become rather romantic
          and had begun to think of sweethearts. But I never dreamed of resisting my father's authority, so I took my
          spankings - which, I must confess, were sometimes well deserved-with as much fortitude as I could muster up.
          But a change in my life was soon to come. My father was seized with an attack of pneumonia, to which he
          succumbed after a few days' illness. I was stunned at first by the suddenness of the blow, but I cannot say
          that I felt much grief at my loss. My father had never made a companion of me, and, whenever I had tried to
          interest him in my little affairs, he had invariably shown himself utterly unsympathetic. However I had not
          much time to think over the past; my position r s it was at that moment had to be faced, and a most
          unfortunate one it was. My father had died in debt, and the creditors were pressing for payment. I had no
          money, so the furniture of the house was sold by auction, and, when everything had been settled, I found
          myself without a cent, homeless and quite alone in the world. I lived for a month with my old nurse. She would
          have kept me with her always, had she been able but she had her own living to make, so she was obliged to go
          into service again. Then I would have been compelled to seek shelter in the poor house had it not been for the
          kindness of a lady who, hearing of my friendless and forlorn condition, took me into her house. Her name was
          Miss Ruth Dean, and she was at that period thirty years of age. She belonged to the Quaker sect, or, as she
          called it, &quot;The Society of Friends.&quot; She was a virgin, she had no lovers, she was her own mistress
          and she lived in a large house about two miles from the city. 19</p>

        <p>She was well off and she made good use of her money, spending most of it in charity. Her time was chiefly
          occupied in philanthropic work of all sorts, and she was always ready to give a helping hand to anyone who
          needed a start in Me. But, before proceeding, I must give you a physical description of Miss Ruth Dean. She
          was a tall, slender, delicately formed woman with large, earnest-looking brown eyes; her hair also was brown;
          it was long and soft and she always wore it in plain bands. She had a lovely clear complexion, but there was
          no colour in her cheeks, though she was in perfect health and was capable of going through a great amount of
          fatigue. She was a pretty woman, but there was always a rather prim expression on her face, and she rarely
          laughed, though she was not the least morose. Miss Dean was as good a woman as ever lived, and she was the
          best friend I ever had. From the first she treated me as a guest and was most kind to me. I had a prettily
          furnished bed-sitting room of my own, and the servants, all of whom were devoted to their mistress, always
          treated me with respect. Miss Dean had a number of correspondents in all parts of the States, and now my
          education proved useful to me, for I was able to help my benefactress in answering her letters. She, finding
          that I was sharp and intelligent, appointed me her secretary, giving me a small salary for pocket money, and
          also supplying me with clothes. I was very comfortable and never had been so happy in all my life. There were
          no cross looks, no sharp scolding, and, above all, no horrid spankings. As time passed Miss Dean became like
          an elder sister to me. I likewise grew very fond of her. She admired my face and figure, and always liked to
          see me nicely dressed, so she gave me lace-trimmed petticoats, drawers and chemises, and also several pretty
          frocks, though she herself was content with the plainest of under linen and she always wore the Quaker
          costume, a plain bodice with a straight-cut skirt of drab, dove-coloured material. 20</p>

        <p>As a matter of course, Miss Dean hated the institution of slavery and was an ardent member of the
          abolitionist party. She supplied funds to and was in constant communication with &quot;Friends&quot; in the
          Southern States who were in charge of &quot;underground stations,&quot; and she frequently received into her
          house escaped slaves of both sexes whom she kept till they got employment. She could harbour the fugitives
          openly because Pennsylvania was a free state. I need not enter into the details of my life for two years, as
          nothing eventful happened. I was contented and happy, I had the society of young people of my own age and I
          had plenty of innocent amusements. Miss Dean, being a Quaker, did not patronize places of public amusement of
          any sort herself, nor would she allow me to go to one; neither did she approve of dancing: but she frequently
          gave quiet parties, and I often was invited to other houses. I was popular with members of my own sex and had
          several admirers among the other sex but, since I did not care for any one of them, I remained quite
          heartwhole. At the time of which I am speaking, the friction between the North and the South was becoming very
          great, and there were mutterings of the storm which was soon to break-though few people thought that things
          would end in a long and bloody civil war. Towards the close of the year, the North was startled by the
          execution, or, as we called it, the murder of the great abolitionist, John Brown, at Harper's Ferry. Miss Dean
          was particularly shocked and distressed at the news, for she had known John Brown personally and she believed
          that he had been quite right in getting up the insurrection which cost him his life. Any act, she averred, was
          justifiable that had for its object the emancipation of the slaves, and she declared that she would not
          hesitate to do the same thing herself if she thought that it would forward the cause. As the weeks passed, she
          became restless. She was not satisfied with merely sending money to the South. She wanted to do something 21
        </p>

        <p>personally to help the slaves, and finally she made up her mind to go South and take charge of an
          &quot;underground station.&quot; She told me one afternoon what she intended to do, and she became quite
          enthusiastic about it, &quot;Oh!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;I am longing to begin the work of rescue. I am
          sure that I could manage a 'station' better than any man. Men are suspected and constantly watched by the
          white loafers, but no one would suspect a woman of running a 'station,' so, if I live quietly and take all
          necessary precautions, I am not likely to be found out.&quot; My sympathies had always been with the slaves,
          and now Miss Dean's enthusiasm moved me greatly. I at once made up my mind to go with her, and I told her of
          my determination. At first she would not hear of my doing such a thing; she pointed out the risks of the
          undertaking and remarked that we might possibly be found out, in which case we should be condemned to a long
          term of imprisonment. &quot;Not that I am afraid of imprisonment,&quot; she added, getting up from her seat
          and pacing up and down the room, her pale cheeks flushing, her soft eyes sparkling. &quot;But for you, Dolly,
          it would be dreadful. You are a young, tender girl, and you could not bear-as I could-the hard work and coarse
          fare. Besides, they would cut off all your pretty hair. I have heard that the hair of female prisoners is cut
          in Southern jails. No, my dear, I can't let you go with me. If I did, and anything were to happen to you, I
          should never forgive myself.&quot; &quot;I am not afraid of the work,&quot; I said, &quot;and you have just as
          pretty hair as I have. If you choose to risk yours, I am ready to risk mine. Do you think, after all you have
          done for me, that I will let you go alone? I will not be left behind. Where you go, I go, and I will take my
          chance with you.&quot; I saw that she was much touched by my fidelity, but still she tried her utmost to
          dissuade me from going South with her. However, I was firm in my resolve to accompany her, so I met all her
          arguments and I wound up by saying that &quot;two heads are better than one,&quot; and that I could be of
          great assistance to her. 22</p>

        <p>So, at last, she consented to let me go with her. The point being settled, she kissed me, then sitting down,
          she wrote to &quot;Friends&quot; in various parts of the South, asking them to let her know a place where a
          new &quot;underground station&quot; might advantageously be established. We then went to dinner, and, when it
          was over, we spent the evening talking over our plans and settling to the best of our ability what we should
          do. In a few days' time, Miss Dean received answers from all her correspondents. They mentioned several places
          where an &quot;underground station&quot; might be set up. We discussed the advantages of the various sites,
          and, after a long deliberation, we determined to go to a place in Virginia, right in the middle of the slave
          states. The house which had been recommended to be used as a &quot;station&quot; was situated near the small
          town of Hampton, on the James River thirtyfive miles from Richmond, the capital of the state. Miss Dean at
          once wrote to a local house-agent, telling him to take the house for her and to have it furnished as soon as
          possible for the reception of two ladies who wished to spend some time in Virginia. Presently she received a
          letter from the agent, saying that he had taken the house for her and that it would be furnished and ready for
          occupation in a fortnight's time. I need hardly tell you that the agent had not the slightest idea that the
          house was going to be used as an &quot;underground station.&quot; The following day we began leisurely to make
          preparations for our departure, and Miss Dean decided to take only one servant, a trustworthy, middle-aged
          white woman named Martha. She was a Quaker like her mistress, in whose service she had been for five years.
          She knew why we were going to Virginia and was quite willing to accompany us. The other servants were left
          behind in charge of the house in Philadelphia. Miss Dean thought it would be safer not to let anyone in the
          city know the exact spot to which we were going, or what we 23</p>

        <p>intended to do, so she merely let it be known that we were going for a trip to the South. A fortnight passed,
          and one fine morning at the beginning of May we drove quietly to the Railway Depot and took our tickets for
          Richmond. On arriving we stayed at a hotel for a couple of days in order to get some stores we wanted. Then,
          on the third morning at half-past eleven, we left the city in a two-horse buggy driven by a Negro coachman,
          who deposited the three of us with our trunks at the house after a long but pleasant drive through a pretty
          country. The agent to whom Miss Dean had written was waiting to receive us, with a couple of Negro boys to
          carry in our baggage. He showed us the house, which we found to be in good repair and plainly but comfortably
          furnished. Everything was in perfect readiness-supplies laid in, wood chopped and the fire in the kitchen
          lighted. The house was very secluded. It was situated at the end of a lane about a quarter of a mile from the
          main road. It was a wooden structure of one story with a veranda back and front. It contained a parlour, a
          kitchen and four bedrooms. In the rear there was a barn, near which grew two hickory trees. The whole place
          was surrounded by a high, rail fence. When we had completed the inspection of our new home, the agent bade us
          goodbye and took his departure, accompanied by the two Negro boys. Martha bustled about the kitchen, while
          Miss Dean and I unpacked our things in our respective bedrooms. In a short time tea was ready and we sat down
          in the parlour to a good meal of ham and eggs, fried chicken and hot cakes. The parlour was a good-sized room
          with rather a low ceiling crossed by heavy beams. There were two bow windows with latticed panes, and on the
          sills were pots of sweet-smelling flowers. On one side of the room was a massive sideboard of polished
          mahogany, and there was an old-fashioned oval mirror with an ebony frame over the mantelpiece. These two bits
          of old furniture evidently belonged to the house, and 24</p>

        <p>they contrasted strangely with the bright coloured carpet and other modern furniture of the room. When we had
          finished our meal, Miss Dean wrote to the &quot;Friends&quot; in charge of the &quot;underground
          stations&quot; north and south of us, with which we were to be in communication. The station south of ours was
          thirty miles distant, and from it we would receive fugitives, whom we would pass on to the station north for
          us, which was twenty miles away. Then we had a short chat, but, since we were feeling tired after our journey,
          we soon went to bed. I got up bright and early next morning, feeling in high spirits, and, as soon as I had
          had my bath and dressed, I peered into Miss Dean's room. Finding that she was fast asleep, I did not disturb
          her. Instead, going quietly downstairs, I left the house and went for a morning walk along the tree-bordered
          road, and down lanes flanked with hedges of bright-flowered shrubs of species quite unknown to me. I rambled
          about in all directions for an hour without meeting a single white person, though I came across several
          coloured people of both sexes who stared curiously at me, noticing that I was a stranger. When I got back to
          the house, I found Miss Dean waiting for me in the parlour, and, in a short time, Martha brought in breakfast,
          to which I did full justice, for my walk had given me a good appetite. We soon were settled down comfortably,
          and our new and risky life had begun. But neither of us had any forebodings of evil. Miss Dean was always
          cheerful, and I was quite charmed with the novelty of the whole affair. We stored supplies of bacon, flour and
          coffee in the cellar of the house and we hid a couple of mattresses and blankets under the floor of the barn
          in readiness for the fugitives who might arrive at any moment from the station south of ours. 25</p>

          <h2>CHAPTER 2</h2>
        <p> My new style of life; redeeming the slave; our first runaways and how we passed them
          &quot;underground.&quot; The house we lived in was well-adapted for our purpose, owing to its isolated
          position. Our nearest neighbour lived three miles away and the little town of Hampton, whence we got our
          supplies, was also three miles distant. The weather was quite warm; however, it agreed with me, and I was in
          splendid health and condition. Dressed in a plain linen costume with a broad-brimmed straw hat on my head I
          daily roamed about the country, soon making the acquaintance of a number of plantation slaves, who, seeing
          that I took an interest in them, were always glad to talk to me; they used to bring me presents of bits of
          &quot;possum&quot; and &quot;coon,&quot; two animals which the Negroes are very fond of, but neither Miss Dean
          nor I could touch the meat. I sometimes visited the slaves' quarters on the plantations and always was
          heartily welcomed. But I was obliged to pay my visits very secretly, for, if the owners of the slaves or the
          ordinary white folks in the neighbourhood had discovered that I was visiting the quarters, my motives would at
          once have been suspected. (Though the Negroes whose acquaintance we had made never hinted at the subject, I
          felt pretty sure that they all guessed why we had taken up our abode in their midst.) Three months passed, and
          during the whole of that period the work at our station had gone on smoothly. Sometimes in one week we would
          have two or three fugitives; on other occasions several days would pass without a single runaway arriving.
          Whatever the case, they always came after dark to the back of the house and the first thing we did was to give
          them a good meal, then put them in the barn for the night. Next day we fed them well, and, as soon as it was
          dark, we supplied them with a packet of provisions and they started off for the next station, walking all
          night and hiding in the woods during the day. (If, as sometimes happened, the fugitive was a woman who was too
          tired to go on after only one night's rest, we kept her till she felt able to continue her journey.) 26</p>

        <p>The runaways were of all sorts: old men and young men, old women and girls, and sometimes a woman with a baby
          in her arms. Some of the fugitives were in good condition and decently clothed, others were gaunt and ragged,
          having come long distances and having been many days on the road. Some had come even from the extreme South of
          Florida. Many were scarred with the marks of the lash, some bore marks of the branding iron, and others had
          open or half-healed wounds on their bodies. But all the poor creatures who passed through our hands were
          intensely grateful to us, and we often heard their stories, which were in many cases most pitiful. I need not
          enter further into details of our management of the station, but I will give you a short account of one of the
          cases which came under our notice. One night Miss Dean and I were sitting as usual in the parlour, chatting
          and sewing. The lamps had been lit, the curtains had been drawn and everything was quiet and snug. There had
          been no arrivals for upwards of a week, and Miss Dean had just said: &quot;I wonder if anyone will come
          tonight.&quot; Then, suddenly, we heard a low tapping at one of the windows. I ran to the door and opened it,
          and, as I did, a girl staggered up to the threshold, then fell fainting at my feet. I called to Miss Dean,
          who, with Martha, at once came to my assistance. We carried the girl into the parlour and laid her on the
          sofa. She was a very light-coloured quadroon, with a pretty face and long, wavy, dark brown hair, which was
          flowing in disorder over her shoulders. Her age appeared to be about sixteen, but her figure was fully
          developed, the rounded contours of her bosom showing plainly under her thin bodice. (Females of her race soon
          mature.) She was evidently not a field slave, as her hands did not show signs of hard work, and her clothes
          were of good material, though they were draggled and torn to rags. She was wearing a neat pair of shoes, but
          they, as well as her stockings, were covered with mud. We soon brought her round, and she opened her great
          brown eyes which had a hunted look in them, while her face wore an expression of pain and 27</p>

        <p>weariness. We gave her a bowl of soup, and some bread and meat, which she ate ravenously, telling us that she
          had had nothing for twenty-four hours. Because the girl was so weak and ill, we did not send her to the barn.
          Instead, as soon as she had finished her supper, I took her upstairs to the spare room, telling her to undress
          and go to bed. She looked bashfully at me, but after a moment's hesitation took off her frock and petticoats.
          She wore no drawers, and I noticed immediately that the back of her chemise was plentifully stained with spots
          of dried blood. I knew what that meant! Going up to the girl, I raised her chemise and looked at her bottom.
          The whole surface was covered with livid weals, and the skin was cut in a great many places. I soon got her to
          tell me why she had been so severely whipped. It was the old story. She belonged to a planter, a married man
          with young children, who lived about twenty-five miles away. She was one of his wife's maids. Her master had
          taken a fancy to her and had ordered her to be in his dressing room at a certain hour one evening. She was a
          virgin, and she disobeyed the order. Next day she was sent with a note to one of the overseers who took her to
          the shed used as a place of punishment. He then informed her that her master had sent her to be whipped for
          disobedience. She was stretched over the whipping block. Her wrists and ankles were held by two male slaves.
          Then the overseer laid bare her bottom and whipped her with a hickory switch till the blood trickled down her
          thighs. She then was allowed to go, being told that if she did not obey her master she would find herself on
          the whipping block again. But she was a plucky girl, and she determined not to surrender her maidenhead. So
          she ran away that night, sore and bleeding as she was, and made her way for twenty-five miles through the
          woods and byways until she reached our house. She had heard that we were kind to slaves, and she thought that
          we would hide her from her master. 28</p>

        <p>We did hide her, keeping her for a week. Then we sent her on to the next station along with a man who
          happened to arrive just at the right time. Now I will return to my own story, and that of Miss Dean, for our
          fates at this period became linked together even more closely than they had been. Time passed and everything
          continued to go on quietly. Miss Dean was still full of enthusiasm for the work, but I had got rather sick of
          it. The stories of cruelty I constantly was hearing and the sights which I sometimes saw made my heart ache.
          Moreover I was tired of the loneliness of my life. I wanted some companions with whom I could laugh and
          chatter freely and frivolously. Though Miss Dean was always sweet and amiable, her conversation was not of a
          light sort. Occasionally, too, a feeling of fear would come over me: we might be found out. I did not feel so
          brave as formerly. I dreaded being put in jail and having my hair cut. And I did not like the idea of the hard
          labour and the scanty fare. However, so far, I had had no cause for alarm. We had come to be well known by the
          people in the neighbourhood, but no one suspected that the two quiet women living by themselves in the lonely
          house were engaged in unlawful practices. There had never been an instance known of an &quot;underground
          station&quot; being run by women. The ordinary white people-and by that expression I mean the white folks who
          did not own slaves-were always civil to us whenever we had anything to do with them. Many of them were very
          rough-looking fellows, and there were some lazy loafers. But there were also a number of respectable,
          hard-working men with wives and families. Strange to say, all these whites, though not one of them owned a
          Negro, were staunch upholders of slavery. They sold us venison, wild turkeys, and fish, all of which were
          welcome additions to our usual homely fare. 29</p>

        <p>CHAPTER 3 I am chased by a bull in the country and saved by an unknown gentlemen who, in the sequel, proves a
          far more savage bull, differing only in outward shape. I still continued to amuse myself by wandering about
          the country. But it was dull work alone, and I often wished for someone to talk to and to keep me company
          during my walks. At last my wishes were gratified. One afternoon I was strolling along a road, when, on
          turning a corner, I came suddenly upon a small herd of cows, headed by a savage looking bull which, on seeing
          me, stopped and began to paw the ground, its head lowered in a threatening way and its eyes gleaming angrily.
          If I had stood still, the animal might have passed on. But, since I was frightened, I foolishly turned round
          and ran away as fast as I could. The bull, bellowing hoarsely, at once pursued me. I heard its breathing close
          behind me as I ran, shrieking loudly. I expected at any moment to be transfixed by the creature's horns. Just
          in the very nick of time, however, a gentleman on horseback leaped the hedge and, charging the bull,
          belaboured it with a heavy whip till the beast turned tail and dashed up the road. The gentleman then
          dismounted and came to me. I was trembling all over and nearly fainting, and would have fallen to the ground
          had he not put his arm round my waist and held me up. He gave me a draught of wine from a flask which he took
          out of his pocket. Then he made me sit on the grass at the side of the road while he stood in front of me with
          the bridle of his horse over his arm, looking down at my face. &quot;Don't be frightened. The danger is
          past,&quot; he said. &quot;It was lucky, though, that I happened to hear your cries and was able to get to you
          in time.&quot; I soon recovered myself, then I thanked him warmly, at the same time taking a good look at him.
          He was a tall, handsome man, about thirtyfive years of age, with very dark hair and eyes. His face was clean
          shaven except for a long, drooping moustache, which hid his mouth, and he was dressed in a well-fitting riding
          suit. Fastening his horse's 30</p>

        <p>bridle to a tree, he sat beside me on the grass and began to talk in a lively and amusing way, putting me
          quite at ease. Soon I found myself chatting and laughing with him as freely as if I had known him for a long
          time. It was delightful to have a merry companion of the male sex to talk to. My spirits rose and I felt quite
          gay. I think we must have talked for an hour. He told me that his name was Randolph. I had often heard of him.
          He was a bachelor, and was the owner of one of the largest plantations in the neighbourhood. His place, called
          &quot;Woodlands,&quot; was about three miles from our house, and I knew some of his slaves. But I did not tell
          him that. He asked me my name, and, when I told him, he smiled. &quot;I have heard of you and also of Miss
          Dean,&quot; he said. &quot;In fact, I am your landlord; the house you are living in belongs to me.&quot; I was
          rather startled at hearing that. &quot;Oh, are you?&quot; I said. &quot;Yes,&quot; he replied, laughing.
          &quot;And somehow I had got it into my head that my tenants were two ugly old Quaker ladies.&quot; I could not
          help smiling at the way he had spoken. &quot;Miss Dean is a Quaker,&quot; I said, &quot;but she is not ugly,
          nor is she old. She is only thirtytwo years of age. I am her companion, but I am not a Quaker.&quot; &quot;You
          are a very charming young lady, and I am glad to have made your acquaintance,&quot; he said, looking hard in
          my face. I blushed, feeling rather confused by his bold glances; but nevertheless I was pleased with his
          compliment. I was not accustomed to having compliments paid to me. The few young men I had known in
          Philadelphia were Quakers and were not given to paying compliments. 31</p>

        <p>He went on: &quot;You two ladies must find it very dull living all alone, especially in the evenings. What do
          you do with yourselves?&quot; This was an awkward question. &quot;We read and sew,&quot; I replied.
          &quot;Well, I must give myself the pleasure of calling on you some night. I suppose you are always at
          home,&quot; he observed. My heart gave a little jump, and I felt hot and uncomfortable. It would never do to
          have him calling at the house, so I racked my brains to find something to say that would prevent him from
          paying us a visit. &quot;I must beg you not to call. Miss Dean would not like it She is peculiar in her ways,
          and I have to humour her,&quot; I said, rising to my feet and thinking that I had better get home as soon as
          possible so as to avoid being further questioned by him. He also stood up. &quot;If that is the case I will
          not intrude on Miss Dean, but I hope to have the pleasure of seeing you again. Will you meet me here tomorrow
          at three o'clock?&quot; I thought there would be no harm in meeting him. Besides, if I did not, he probably
          would call at the house, and that was a thing to be prevented if possible. So I promised to meet him the
          following afternoon at the hour he had named. Then, shaking hands with him, I bade him goodbye. He held my
          hand longer than was necessary and he also pressed it, at the same time fixing his gleaming black eyes upon
          mine with a look which made me feel rather uncomfortable again. &quot;Goodbye then, Miss Morton, till three
          o'clock tomorrow,&quot; he said. Then mounting his horse, he touched it with his spurs and cantered off,
          turning round in the saddle to wave his hat to me. My eyes followed him with admiration, for he was a graceful
          rider and his horse was a magnificent animal. Moreover, I felt grateful to the 32</p>

        <p>man, for he had undoubtedly saved me from serious injuries, if not death. I walked slowly home, thinking over
          the whole affair, and feeling very light-hearted. A bit of romance had come into my hitherto quiet life, and I
          was pleased. In the future I should have someone to talk to and to walk with. I had an idea that Mr. Randolph
          and I would often meet, but I had not the least thought of harm. On reaching the house, I found Miss Dean
          looking, as usual, sweet and placid, making shirts for ragged fugitives. Kissing me affectionately, she said:
          &quot;You are looking very blooming, Dorothy. What has made your cheeks so rosy this evening?&quot; I laughed,
          telling her that I had been frightened by a bull. But I did not inform her of the danger I had been in, nor
          did I mention Mr. Randolph. I thought it best to keep silent about him, for Miss Dean was very strict in her
          ideas, and she never would have allowed me to meet him. I took off my hat, and we went in to dinner. It was a
          plentiful meal, consisting of fried trout, grilled wild turkey, corn bread, buckwheat cakes and honey. The
          evening was spent in the usual way. We read and sewed till it was time to go to bed. Next day at the appointed
          hour and place I, met Mr. Randolph. He evidently was glad to see me, and, taking both my hands, held them,
          gazing with a look of admiration in my face. (A woman always knows when she is admired.) After exchanging
          greetings, he politely offered his arm, which I took, and we strolled along the road till we came to a
          secluded dell with mossy banks shaded by trees. In this nook we sat side by side on the grass. Then he
          questioned me about myself. I told him that I was an orphan and that I had no relations of any sort. I told
          him also how I had come to be a companion to Miss Dean. But, of course, I did not hint at our reasons for
          coming to live in Virginia. 33</p>

        <p>His manner to me was perfectly respectful, and I remained chatting with him for upwards of an hour. Then I
          went home, promising to meet him again in three days' time. I did meet him, and, from that time, we became
          very friendly, meeting each other two or three times a week. I did not love him in the least, but I liked
          being in his company. He was so utterly different from any man I had ever known. He amused me with stories of
          adventures-he had travelled all over the world-and he interested me with his descriptions of European
          countries, which I was always longing to visit. I soon found out that he was cynical and that he had a very
          low opinion of women, and, from the way he sometimes talked, I had an idea that his disposition was cruel.
          However, he seemed to exercise a sort of fascination over me, so invariably I met him whenever he chose to ask
          me. Up to this point he had treated me politely, but in a condescending sort of way, and I was quick-witted
          enough to perceive that he considered me very much his inferior. He was a rich planter, one of the aristocracy
          of the South, and a member of one of the &quot;FFV's,&quot; as they called themselves, meaning &quot;First
          Families of Virginia,&quot; while I was only the daughter of a poor clerk of no particular family, earning my
          living as companion to a Quaker lady. As time passed I got to like him a little better and consequently was
          more familiar with him, while he became warmer in his manner towards me. But as yet he had not attempted to
          take the least liberty with me. (Little did I suspect that he was only waiting for a favourable opportunity.)
          He lent me books of poetry which were a great source of delight to me, and he often used to read aloud to me
          passages from Byron, Shelley or Keats. One afternoon we were sitting side by side in our favourite nook, and
          he was reading poetry to me. I do not know who was the author, but I remember that the poem was about love.
          Randolph had a musical voice, and he read with passionate feeling, every now and then looking 34</p>

        <p>into my eyes. I became deeply moved by the sweet but rather warm verse, my cheeks flushed, my heart began to
          beat rapidly and my bosom heaved. A sensuous feeling such as I had never experienced took possession of me. I
          closed my eyes and sat in a soft waking-dream. Soon Randolph ceased reading and everything was perfectly still
          except for the far-off song of a mockingbird. Presently I felt his arm steal around my waist, then he drew me
          onto his lap and pressed his lips to mine in a long lass. It was the first time that I had ever been kissed by
          a man, and I felt a thrill pass through me from head to foot. But I did not attempt to get away. The kiss
          seemed to have me mesmerized. Pressing me to his breast, Randolph now covered my face with kisses, calling me
          all sorts of endearing names and telling me that he loved me. I lay quietly in his arms, feeling unable to
          move, and my quietness emboldened him. After a moment or two, he put his hand up under my petticoats and felt
          my bottom through the slit of my drawers. Now my senses returned. The touch of the man's hand on such a part
          of my body acted like a galvanic shock. My sensuous feeling was instantly changed to a feeling of outraged
          modesty..&quot; realized my danger and began to struggle violently in his arms, at the same time calling out
          to him to let me go. But he paid no attention to what I said, and I was unable to free myself from his
          powerful grasp. Laying me down upon my back, he pulled up my clothes, and, tearing open my drawers, tried to
          separate my thighs, which I instinctively kept pressed together. I resisted with all my power, shrieking and
          buffeting him in the face with both my hands, but he soon prevented my doing that by seizing my wrists and
          holding my arms down at my sides. Then, pressing his chest upon my bosom, he crushed me under his weight.
          Thrusting his knees between my legs, he forced my thighs apart, in spite of all my efforts to prevent him.
          Then I felt his stiff member touching my belly in different places as he tried to penetrate 35</p>

        <p>me. But he could not; for, though I was filled with horror and burning with shame, I did not lose my head,
          and I saw that he could not effect his purpose so long as I kept moving my loins. I did not exhaust myself by
          violent struggling, but merely twisted myself about, and, every time I felt his &quot;thing&quot; touch my
          &quot;spot,&quot; I jerked my hips to one side. By so doing, I prevented him from getting into me. Again and
          again he tried to sheath the weapon, but could not manage to do it. I was strong, healthy and in good
          condition, so I fought hard in defence of my virginity, at the same time uttering a succession of loud
          shrieks. It was a terrible fight! All my muscles were aching from the strain. Every nerve in my body was
          strung to the utmost tension. His weight was squeezing the breath out of me. My bosom heaved as though it
          would have burst, my eyes were starting out of my head and I was filled with a horrible feeling of loathing.
          But I continued to resist stubbornly, until, at last, fearing, I suppose, that my screams would be heard, he
          ceased his efforts to rape me, and, uttering a bitter curse, let me go. Then, rising to his feet, he buttoned
          up his trousers. I sprang to my feet, panting for breath and trembling all over. The tears were streaming down
          my cheeks. I was hoarse from screaming. My clothes were torn. My hair had come down and was flowing in
          disorder, partly hiding my scarlet face. Overwhelmed with shame, I was about to run away when he seized me by
          the arm, and, glaring at me with a cruel look in his eyes, hissed out in a savage tone: &quot;You little fool!
          Why did you resist me?&quot; &quot;Let me go, you horrid wretch!&quot; I exclaimed fiercely. &quot;How dare
          you look me in the face after what you have done to me? Oh! You beast! But I will have you prosecuted. I will
          go to the police and have you put in jail. He smiled an evil smile and darted a baleful glance at me. &quot;Oh
          no, my little girl; you won't go to the police when you have heard what I am going to tell you,&quot; he said,
          pinching my arm. &quot;Now you needn't struggle. I'm done with you for the present, and I'll let you go in a
          36</p>

        <p>moment. But you must first listen to what I have to say. I know what Miss Dean and you are doing here. You
          are keeping an 'underground station.' I suspected you both from the first, so I watched the house at night on
          several occasions, and I soon found out the game which was being carried on. For certain reasons, which I
          daresay you can guess, I did not give the information to the police. But you and Miss Dean are in my power,
          and if I choose now to let the authorities know what you have been doing, you will find yourselves in a very
          short time at hard labour in the State's prison.&quot; I was startled and frightened, for I saw at once that
          we were entirely at the man's mercy. But I was so thoroughly upset by the outrage which I had suffered that I
          could not find a word to say. I could only weep. Changing his tone, he went on: &quot;But I don't want to
          inform against you. I wish to be your friend. I am fond of you, and, when you let me kiss you so quietly just
          now, I thought that you were willing to let me go further. I am sorry I treated you so roughly and I
          apologize. But I want you. Leave Miss Dean and come live with me. You shall have everything a woman can
          desire, and I will settle a thousand dollars a year on you for life. And I will promise not to lay information
          against Miss Dean or to interfere with her in any way.&quot; As things turned out, it would have been-far
          better for me had I then accepted his offer. But at that moment I was full of rage and shame. Moreover, being
          a perfectly pure girl, I was utterly revolted at the cool way in which he had offered to buy my virtue. Though
          I dreaded the prison, I said to myself that I would rather go there than surrender to the man. &quot;No!
          No!&quot; I exclaimed. &quot;I will not leave Miss Dean. You may tell the police, if you are such a brute. I
          will go to jail, but I will not live with you. I hate the very sight of you! Oh! Go away and leave me, you
          wretch!&quot; 37</p>

        <p>Again the cruel look came to his face and he pushed me roughly, saying in a tone of suppressed anger:
          &quot;Very well, Miss Dorothy Morton, I will go away now. But we shall meet again some day, and I think that
          you will be sorry for having refused my offer.&quot; Then, bowing to me with mock politeness, he turned on his
          heel and walked rapidly away, leaving me weeping and dishevelled. 38</p>

        <p>CHAPTER 4 The results of my resistance; the futility of goodness; an unwelcome visit, which leads to the
          humiliation of our persons and the ravishment of my virgin state. As soon as he was out of sight, I twisted up
          my hair and arranged the disorder of my attire as much as was possible; then I hurried home, and fortunately
          got up to my room without being seen by either Miss Dean or Martha. Locking the door, I undressed, for my
          clothes were in a dreadful state; my frock, a white one, was torn at the gathers nearly all the way round, and
          the back was stained green; the strings of my petticoats were broken, my chemise was torn and my drawers were
          hanging in ribbons about my legs; my thighs were covered with black marks made by the pressure of the man's
          fingers, and I was sore and bruised all over. After I had put on clean things I threw myself on the bed,
          buried my face in the pillow and cried. But my tears now were angry ones, for the keenness of my shame had
          somewhat worn off. I was enraged at my foolishness in having trusted myself alone with Randolph, for whom I
          had a feeling of distrust ever since he had expressed to me his low opinion of the virtue of women. I also
          felt degraded in my own estimation that he should have taken for granted that I was the sort of girl who would
          give herself up to a man for the asking. I am sure that I had never given him the least encouragement. Then I
          remembered that he had said that I would be sorry for not accepting his offer. I had made an enemy of him, so
          most probably he would give information about us to the police. It was not pleasant to think of. I felt that I
          ought to let Miss Dean know that we had been found out, but, had I done so, I should have been obliged to
          enter into all the details of my affair with Randolph. And I could not bear to tell her of the outrage which I
          had been subjected to. Altogether, through my imprudence, we were in a dreadful fix, and 39</p>

        <p>there was nothing to be done but wait miserably for the end, which would be in the jail. (Already in my mind
          I pictured Miss Dean and myself clad in coarse prison garments, and with our hair cropped short, toiling at
          some hard labour.) Presently Martha knocked at the door to tell me that tea was ready; so I had to pull myself
          together and go down to the parlour. I could not eat much, and Miss Dean noticed at once my want of appetite;
          she also saw that my face was pale and my eyes red, and she asked me what was the matter. I told her that I
          had a bad headache, which was the truth. On hearing that, the kind-hearted woman made me lie on the sofa while
          she bathed my forehead with eau de Cologne. Then she recommended that I go to bed, so that I might have a long
          night's rest and sleep off the headache. But I did not sleep well. My rest was broken by a succession of
          horrid dreams in which I fancied that I was struggling in the arms of a man with an enormous member, who
          always succeeded in overcoming my resistance and taking my maidenhead. In the morning, while dressing, I
          wondered where we should be in twenty-four hours' time, for I fully expected that Miss Dean and I would be
          arrested before the night came. The day wore slowly away. I was uneasy and restless, I could not settle down
          to my usual routine of work. I was constantly peeping out of the window watching for the arrival of the
          police. They did not come. But, at nine o'clock, a runaway made his appearance in a starving condition, and,
          in attending to the poor creature's wants, I forgot for the time, my own precarious position. Several days
          went by quietly and I began to think that Randolph after all was not going to be so mean as to inform on us.
          But all the same I was very anxious to get out of the state of Virginia, so I said to Miss Dean that I thought
          we had now done our share of the work and that 40</p>

        <p>we ought to go back to Philadelphia. Miss Dean however would not hear of such a thing. She said we were doing
          good work and that we must go on with it, for some time longer at any rate. Another fortnight passed, during
          which period three fugitives had arrived, two men and a woman, all of whom we had sent on to the next station
          without, as far as I knew, exciting any suspicion, and, since nothing had occurred to alarm me, my spirits
          rose and I became quite myself again. I had not seen Randolph since the day he had assaulted me, but I often
          had thought of the shameful affair, the recollection of it always sending the blood in a hot flood to my
          cheeks. I had a hatred for the man and hoped that I should never again set eyes on him. But, alas! I was fated
          to see him before long, under the most painful circumstances. One afternoon, about five o'clock, we were
          sitting in the veranda at the front of the house. Miss Dean, looking very sweet and pretty in a dove-coloured
          dress, was as usual usefully employed in making shirts for the runaways, while I was engaged in trimming a hat
          for myself. Martha was in the kitchen washing up plates and dishes, for we had just finished tea. I was in
          good spirits, and as I worked I sang to myself in a low voice a plantation song I had learned from the
          Negroes, called &quot;Carry Me Back To Ole Virginny.&quot; It was strange that I should have been singing that
          particular song, for I was very anxious to get away from &quot;Ole Virginny&quot; and had I been out of that
          state I certainly would not have asked anyone to carry me back to it. Presently the stillness of the evening
          was broken by the clatter of horses' hoofs mingled with the sound of loud voices in the distance, and, on
          looking down the lane, I saw a number of men, some of them mounted, some on foot, coming towards the house.
          Miss Dean and I gazed at them as they came along, and we wondered where they were all going; people very
          rarely entered our secluded lane. 41</p>

        <p>To our surprise, the party stopped at the house, the men on horseback dismounting and hitching their horses
          to the fence. Then the whole crowd came into the veranda and gathered round us as we sat, in silent
          astonishment, on our chairs. I noticed however, that there was a hard stern look on the face of every man,
          while some of them scowled at us with angry glances. There were fifteen men, all of whom were quite unknown to
          me, even by sight. Most of them were bearded, rough looking fellows, dressed in coarse cotton shirts of
          various colours, with their trousers tucked into boots reaching to the knees, and wearing slouch hats on their
          heads. But there were some men better dressed, and evidently of a higher class. My heart began to flutter, and
          a vague foreboding of evil came over me, for, though I had not the least suspicion of what the men's
          intentions were, I guessed from their looks that they had not come to pay us a friendly visit. One of the
          intruders, a man about forty years of age, who was addressed by the others as Jake Stevens and who appeared to
          be the leader of the band, stepped forward, and laying his hand on Miss Dean's shoulder, at the same time
          looking at me, said sternly: &quot;Stand up you two, I've got sumthin' to say to you.&quot; We both rose to
          our feet, and Miss Dean asked in a quiet tone: &quot;Why have you and your companions invaded my house in this
          rough manner?&quot; The man laughed scornfully, saying, &quot;Well, I should say you orter pretty well guess
          what's brought us here. You ain't so innocent as you look, by a long chalk.&quot; Then, with an oath, he went
          on: &quot;It has come to the knowledge of the white folks in these parts that you are keeping an 'underground
          station.' Since you have been here you have got away a great many slaves. Now I jest tell you that we
          Southerners don't allow no darned Northern abolitionists to run off our slaves. When we 42</p>

        <p>ketches abolitionists we makes it hot for them, and now that we've ketched you and your assistant, we are
          going to bring you before Judge Lynch's court. The boys who have come here with me are the gentlemen of the
          jury. Isn't that the right talk boys?&quot; he said to the men round him. &quot;Yes, yes, Jake. That's the
          talk. You've put it the right way,&quot; shouted several voices. I sank down on my chair, horribly frightened.
          I had heard dreadful stories of the cruelties perpetrated under the name of &quot;Lynch.&quot; Miss Dean again
          spoke calmly: &quot;If you have found out that we have broken the law of the State, why have you not informed
          the police? You have no right to take the law into your own hands.&quot; There was an angry movement among the
          men, and a hubbub of voices rose. &quot;We've got the right to do as we please.&quot; &quot;Lynch Law is good
          enough for the likes of you.&quot; &quot;Shut your mouth.&quot; &quot;Don't waste any more time talking to
          her, Jake. Let's get to business,&quot; was shouted. &quot;All right boys,&quot; said Stevens, &quot;well go
          into the garden right away and settle what shall be done with the prisoners. We know they're guilty, so we've
          only got to sentence them, and then well proceed to carry out the sentence of the court.&quot; Miss Dean and I
          were left on the veranda while the men, all trooping out into the garden, gathered in a cluster and began to
          talk; but they were too far off for us to hear what was being said. I sat huddled up in my chair, with a
          dreadful sinking at my heart. &quot;Oh Miss Dean,&quot; I wailed, &quot;what will they do to us?&quot; &quot;I
          do not know dear,&quot; she replied, coming over to me and taking my hand. &quot;I am not very much concerned
          about myself, but, oh, my poor 43</p>

        <p>girl, I am so sorry for you. I never should have allowed you to come here.&quot; Too miserable to say another
          word, I sat pale and silent. The men continued talking together, and there seemed to be differences of opinion
          among them, but I could not catch a word that was said. The suspense to me was dreadful, my mouth was parched
          and I turned alternately hot and cold. But Miss Dean, who still held my hand, occasionally pressing it, was
          quite calm. At last the men seemed to have agreed, and they all returned to the veranda. Then Stevens,
          assuming a sort of judicial manner, addressed us, saying: &quot;The sentence of the court upon you two is that
          you are each to receive a whipping with a hickory switch on the bare bottom, then you are both to be made to
          ride a rail for two hours, and, further, you are warned to leave the state of Virginny within forty-eight
          hours. If at the end of that time you are found in the State, Judge Lynch will have something more to say to
          you.&quot; When I heard the shameful and cruel sentence which the lynchers had passed upon us, my blood ran
          cold and I trembled all over. There was a singing in my ears, and a mist came before my eyes. I rose from my
          seat, my legs shaking under me so much that I had to hold the back of my chair to support myself. &quot;Oh,
          you surely don't mean to whip us!&quot; I exclaimed in piteous accents, stretching out my arms appealingly to
          the men. &quot;Oh, don't put us to such awful shame and pain. Have pity on us. Oh, do have pity on us.&quot;
          But there was not the least sign of pity on any of the faces surrounding us. Ah were stern, or frowning, or
          stolid. And one man called out: &quot;Serves you right, you darned little abolitionist. You both ought to be
          stripped naked and tarred and feathered after the whipping and then perched on the rail. You would look like a
          queer brace of birds.&quot; 44</p>

        <p>At this coarse joke, there was a burst of laughter from the other men and I again sank down on my chair
          wringing my hands in despair while the tears streamed down my white cheeks. Miss Dean, however, faced the men
          boldly. She turned very pale, but her eyes were bright and she showed no signs of fear. Addressing the leader,
          she said without a tremor in her voice: &quot;I have often been told that the Southerners were chivalrous in
          their treatment of women, but I find that I have been misinformed. Chivalrous men do not whip women.&quot;
          &quot;I don't know nothing about chivalrous,&quot; said Stevens gruffly, &quot;but when women acts like men
          and sets to running an 'underground station' they must take the consequences.&quot; The men in various terms,
          garnished with oaths, expressed their approval of what their leader had said. Miss Dean calmly continued:
          &quot;I wish you all to know that I am the only person in this house responsible for what has been done. The
          young lady is not to blame in any way. She is my paid companion and has acted entirely under my orders. You
          must let her go free.&quot; &quot;Oh no we won't,&quot; exclaimed several voices at once. &quot;She must have
          her share of the switch.&quot; &quot;Let me do the talking,&quot; said Stevens. &quot;We know very well, Miss
          Dean, that you are the boss of this yer show, but the girl has been helpin' you to run it, so she's got to be
          whipped. But she won't git such a smart touchin' up as you will. Isn't that right boys?&quot; he asked.
          &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;That's all right,&quot; some of them answered. &quot;Let the gal off a
          bit easier than the woman.&quot; Just then one of the men called out: &quot;Whar's the hired woman? She ought
          to have her bottom switched, and get a ride on the rail as well as the others.&quot; &quot;Certainly she
          ought,&quot; said Stevens. &quot;A couple of you go and bring her here. I guess she's hiding somewhere in the
          house.&quot; Two of the men went 45</p>

        <p>into the house and while they were away the others talked and laughed with each other, making ribald remarks
          that caused me to blush and shiver. But Miss Dean did not appear to hear what was being said. She stood quite
          still, her hands loosely clasped in front of her and a far-off look in her great, soft, brown eyes. In about
          five minutes' time, the two men returned and one of them said with an oath: &quot;We can't find the bitch
          anywhere in the house, though we have looked well. She must have run off into the woods.&quot; &quot;It's a
          pity she's got away,&quot; said Stevens, &quot;but anyhow we've got the two leading ladies of the show, and I
          guess we'll make them both feel sorry that they ever took a hand in the game.&quot; &quot;You bet we will,
          Jake,&quot; shouted the men. &quot;We'll make them sorry they ever came to Virginny. Let's get to work at
          once.&quot; &quot;Very well,&quot; said Stevens. &quot;Bill, you run to the barn and fetch the ladder you'll
          find there. Pete and Sam, you go and cut a couple of good, long, springy hick'ry switches and trim them ready
          for me to use.&quot; Then he added with a laugh: &quot;I daresay these yere northern ladies have often eaten
          hick'ry nuts, but I reckon they never thought they would feel a hick'ry switch on their bare bottoms.&quot;
          The men all joined in the laugh, while I shuddered and my heart swelled with bitterness at our utter
          helplessness. The ladder and the switches were brought, then all the men went into the garden. The ladder then
          was fixed in a sloping position against the rail of the veranda on the outside, and Stevens took up his
          position near it, holding one of the switches in his hand, while the other men stood round in a ring so that
          they might all have a good look at what was going to be done. &quot;Bring out the prisoners,&quot; said
          Stevens. Some of the men took hold of us by the arms and led us out of the veranda to receive the cruel and 46
        </p>

        <p>indecent punishment. I was trembling and crying; but Miss Dean was calm and silent. Stevens said to her:
          &quot;Since you're the boss, you shall be whipped first. Tie her up, boys.&quot; She immediately was seized by
          two men and laid upon the ladder. Her arms were stretched out to their full extent above her head and her
          wrists were tied with thick cords to the rungs of the ladder. Her ankles were securely fastened the same way.
          She had not shown the least resistance nor had she uttered a word while being tied up, but now she turned her
          head and looking over her shoulder at Stevens said: &quot;Can you not whip me without removing my
          clothes?&quot; &quot;No, certainly not,&quot; he replied. &quot;You was sentenced to be whipped on the bare
          bottom. Turn up her clothes, boys.&quot; Her skirt, petticoats and chemise were rolled high above her waist
          and tucked under her body so that they could not fall down. She had not on the ordinary drawers with a slit
          behind, such as are usually worn by women, but was wearing long pantelettes which were buttoned up all round,
          fitting rather closely to her legs and reaching down to her ankles, around which the little frills at the end
          of the garment were drawn in with narrow ribbons. &quot;Why darn me, if she ain't got on white trousers!&quot;
          ejaculated Stevens in a tone of astonishment. &quot;I never seen such things on a woman before.&quot; The
          other men also seemed surprised and very much amused at the sight of the trousers, and various remarks were
          made by some of the spectators. I suppose that women of their class in that part of the country never wore
          drawers of any sort. &quot;Take down her trousers,&quot; said Stevens. Again Miss Dean looked around.
          &quot;Please leave me my pantalettes. They won't protect me much. Do not expose my nakedness to all these
          men,&quot; she pleaded earnestly. 47</p>

        <p>But no attention was paid to her entreaty. One of the men roughly put his hands in front of her belly and
          after some fumbling unbuttoned the pantalettes and pulled them down to her ankles, leaving her person naked
          from the waist to the tops of her black silk stockings. When her last garment had been removed, her pale
          cheeks blushed scarlet. Even the nape of her neck and her ears became red. A shudder shook her body from head
          to foot, she bent her head down and she closed her eyes. I was being held by two men close to the ladder, so I
          could not help seeing everything. Miss Dean, as I have before said, was a tall, slim, slightly built woman.
          Her hips were very narrow and her bottom very small, but it was round, well shaped and fairly plump; her
          thighs and legs also were well formed though slender; her skin was of a delicate ivory tint, smooth, and fine
          in texture. The men pressed closer to the ladder, and I could see their eyes glisten as they fixed them with
          lecherous looks on Miss Dean's half-naked body. Stevens, after gazing for a moment or two at her straight
          figure, exclaimed with a laugh: &quot;Je-ru-sa-lem! What a little bottom she's got. It ain't no bigger than a
          man's. By gosh, boys! Perhaps she is a man!&quot; This was meant as a joke. It amused the men and they all
          laughed, one of them calling out: &quot;Well Jake, you can easily find out whether she's a woman or not.&quot;
          &quot;Why, so I can, now that you have put it in my head,&quot; drawled Stevens, grinning and pretending to be
          surprised at the suggestion. Then he thrust his hand between her thighs. Miss Dean flinched convulsively,
          uttering a startled cry. Then, looking round at the man with an expression of intense horror on her face and
          with her eyes flashing, she exclaimed: &quot;How dare you touch me like that?! Take your hand away! Oh, whip
          me and let me go!&quot; 48</p>

        <p>She writhed and twisted, but the man kept his hand in the cleft of her thighs, saying with a coarse laugh:
          &quot;She's a woman sure enough, boys. I've got my hand on her slit.&quot; Then he said to her: &quot;My hand
          won't hurt you. But if I and these other gentlemen were not decent sort of chaps who only intend to carry out
          the sentence of Judge Lynch, you would soon find something different to a hand between your legs. Now I'll
          whip you right away, and I guess you'll soon be begging me to stop whipping you.&quot; He withdrew his hand,
          and Miss Dean ceased struggling. Her head drooped forward. She again closed her eyes and lay silently awaiting
          the shameful punishment. Stevens raised the switch and flicked it about so as to make it hiss in the air. Then
          he brought it down with considerable force across the upper part of her bottom, the tough hickory spray making
          a sharp crack as it struck the firm flesh which quivered involuntarily under the stinging stroke. Miss Dean
          winced, drawing her breath through her teeth with a hissing sound. A long red weal instantly rose on her
          delicate skin. Swinging the switch high, Stevens went on whipping, laying each stroke below the preceding one
          so that her skin soon was striped in regular lines. Each stroke smacked loudly on her flesh, and each one
          raised a fresh, red weal which stretched across both sides of her quivering bottom. She began to writhe, and
          she clenched her teeth so tightly that I could see the outlines of her jaws through her cheeks, but no sound
          came from her lips. The man laid on the strokes with severity, and I wondered how she could bear the pain in
          silence. I felt inclined to scream, and I shuddered every time that I heard the horrid sound made by the
          switch as it fell on her flesh. 49</p>

        <p>Stevens continued to whip her ruthlessly and slowly, pausing between each stroke. The weals increased in
          number and her skin grew redder until at last there was not a trace of white to be seen on the whole surface
          of her bottom. Her flesh twitched, she winced more sharply, she writhed more and she jerked her loins from
          side to side as the hissing strokes fell. Then, raising her head and looking over her shoulder, she fixed her
          eyes, which had become dilated and wild looking, on the switch every time it rose in the air. Her lips were
          quivering, her pretty face was distorted with pain, the big tears were streaming down her scarlet cheeks and
          she began to moan. Still Stevens plied the hickory. Drops of blood began to show all over the surface of the
          skin. Her contortions became more violent and she uttered a groan every time the switch raised a fresh weal on
          her bleeding bottom. But the brave woman never once screamed, nor did she make an appeal for mercy. Her
          fortitude amazed me. At last Stevens stopped whipping and threw down the switch which had become quite frayed
          at the end. Then, bending down, he closely examined the marks of his handiwork on the sufferer's bottom. I
          also gazed at it, shuddering. The whole surface from the loins to the thighs was a dark red colour; it was
          covered with livid weals crossing and re-crossing each other in all directions, and it was plentifully spotted
          with blood. It was dreadfully sore looking and its extreme redness contrasted with the ivory-like whiteness of
          the untouched skin of the thighs. She had been most severely whipped. I think she must have received forty or
          fifty strokes. &quot;There boys,&quot; said Stevens, looking round at the spectators, &quot;I guess that will
          do for her. I touched her up pretty smartly, as you can see by the state of her bottom. She won't be able to
          sit down comfortable for two or three days, and I don't think the marks of the whipping will ever be quite
          rubbed off her skin.&quot; 50</p>

        <p>He then pulled down her clothes and unfastened her wrists and ankles. She stood up, twisting her loins in
          pain, with her pantalettes hanging about her feet. Her face now was pale and drawn with suffering, her bosom
          was heaving, her tears were flowing and she was sobbing. She seemed oblivious of everything except her pain.
          But, after a few moments, she recovered herself a little and, taking her handkerchief from her pocket, wiped
          the tears from her eyes. Then she pulled up her pantalettes and with some difficulty-for she was trembling
          very much-buttoned them around her waist, her cheeks again reddening when she noticed the grinning faces and
          leering looks of the men standing round her. Two of the men then took her by the arms and led her into the
          veranda, where they left her. She laid herself down at full length upon a couch and hid her face in the
          cushion, weeping. 51</p>

        <p>CHAPTER 5 I am stripped naked and receive a most terrible whipping; the coarse observations of the men; my
          shame and terror, showing from experience that chastisement by the opposite sex awakens sensations sometimes
          far from pleasurable. I have told you all these things precisely as they happened, and I have used the exact
          words and phrases which were spoken by the band of lynchers who tortured us that day. I daresay you wonder at
          my remembering all the little details. But such an experience can never be forgotten: all the incidents which
          occurred during that dreadful period were indelibly printed on my memory so that I have still a vivid
          recollection of them. But to resume. You can imagine my feelings as I listened to the coarse language of the
          men, language such as I had never before heard, and as I watched the proceedings at once so cruel and so
          utterly revolting the feminine delicacy. I was torn with various emotions. I was horrified at what I had heard
          and seen; I was filled with pity for Miss Dean; I was consumed with impotent rage against the men in whose
          power we were; I dreaded the coming exposure of my person, and I was awfully afraid of the whipping before me.
          I never could bear pain with any fortitude. In fact, I must confess that I am morally and physically a great
          coward. Stevens picked up the unused switch and straightened it by drawing it through the fingers of his left
          hand. &quot;Now boys,&quot; he said, &quot;put the gal on the ladder and tie her up but let me do the
          stripping.&quot; The awful moment had come, and I became quite frantic at the thought of the shame and pain
          which I was about to undergo. An insane idea that I might escape came into my head. The men were holding me
          loosely, so I easily slipped from their grasp and made a dash for the garden gate. Several of the men gave
          chase, and, though I exerted myself to the utmost, I soon was caught and dragged to the ladder, shrieking,
          struggling and begging them not to whip me. But my entreaties evoked only laughter. I was lifted up, was
          placed in position 52</p>

        <p>with outstretched arms and was securely bound at the wrists and the ankles. Stevens now began to strip me and
          seemed to take as long a time over the work as possible, slowly rolling my garments up one by one till he came
          to my drawers. Then he paused. I was wearing the usual feminine drawers that are open behind. &quot;Look,
          boys,&quot; he observed, &quot;this gal has got on trousers too, but they are different from the ones the
          woman wore. These are loose, and are real dandy ones, all pretty frills and lace and ribbons. And, you see,
          there is a big slit at the back. I suppose that's there so her sweetheart can get at her without taking down
          her trousers.&quot; The men all laughed loudly, while I, on hearing the shameful words, shrank as if I had
          received a blow. Stevens now untied the strings of my drawers and pulled them down to my knees. I could feel
          the breeze fanning my naked bottom and thighs. A sensation of unutterable shame overwhelmed me. To be exposed
          in such a way before fifteen men! And such men! Oh! It was horrible! I knew that they were all gloating over
          my nakedness, and I seemed actually to feel their lascivious glances on my flesh. I was hot with shame, yet I
          shivered as with cold. But worse was yet to come. Stevens put his hand on my bottom, stroking it all over and
          squeezing the flesh with his fingers, making me thrill and quiver with disgust. In fact, my feelings of shame
          and horror at the moment were far greater than they had been when Randolph assaulted me. &quot;Ah!&quot; said
          Stevens, chuckling and continuing to feel me with his rough hand, &quot;this gal has got something like a
          bottom. My! Ain't it jest plump and firm and broad. There's plenty of room here for the switch, and her skin
          is as soft and smooth as velvet. You can see how white it is. I've 53</p>

        <p>never before had my hand on such a scrumptious bottom. It's worth feeling, and no mistake,&quot; I writhed
          and moaned. He went on: &quot;I should like all of you to have a feel of it, but as leader of this yer party,
          I can't allow you to touch the gal for fear some of you might want to do more than feel her, and that would
          lead to difficulties among us. Now, as to the punishment of the gal. I propose to give her a dozen strokes,
          but not to draw blood. Remember, she's only an assistant in the business.&quot; The men were divided in
          opinion. Some said that I ought to be whipped just the same as the &quot;misses&quot;; but the majority was in
          favour of my receiving only twelve strokes. And so it was settled. Even in my fear and shame, I felt a wave of
          relief at hearing that I was not going to be whipped so severely as Miss Dean had been. One of the men called
          out: &quot;Mind you, lay on the dozen right smart, Jake. Make the young bitch wriggle her bottom.&quot;
          &quot;You bet I'll lay them on smart, and you'll see how she'll move. I know how to handle a hick'ry switch,
          and I'll rule a dozen lines across her bottom that'll make it look like the American flag, striped red and
          white. And when I've done with her I guess she'll be pretty sore behind, but you'll see that I won't draw a
          drop of blood. Yes, gentlemen, I tell you again that I know how to whip. I was an overseer in Georgia for five
          years.&quot; All the time that Stevens was holding forth I lay shame-stricken at my nakedness and shivering in
          awful suspense, the flesh of my bottom creeping and the scalding tears trickling down my red cheeks. Finally
          he raised the switch and flourished it over me, while I held my breath and contracted the muscles of my bottom
          in dread of the coming stroke. It fell with a loud swishing noise. Oh! It was awful! The pain was even worse
          than I had anticipated. It took my breath away for a moment and 54</p>

        <p>made me gasp. Then I uttered a loud shriek, writhing and twisting my loins in agony. Stevens went on whipping
          me very slowly, so that I felt the full sting of each stroke before the next one fell. Every stroke felt as if
          a red-hot iron was being drawn across my bottom. I winced and squirmed each time the horrid switch fell
          sharply on my quivering flesh. I shrieked and screamed and I swung my hips from side to side, arching my loins
          at one moment and then flattening myself down on the ladder, while, between my shrieks, I begged and prayed
          the man to stop whipping me. I had forgotten all about my nakedness now. The only sensation I had at the
          moment was one of intense pain. When the twelve strokes had been inflicted, I was in a half-fainting state. I
          was left lying on the ladder with upturned petticoats while the men all gathered round me and looked at me.
          Because I was a strong healthy girl, the faintness soon passed off, as also did the first intense smart of the
          whipping. But my whole bottom was sore, and the weals throbbed painfully. The feeling of shame again came over
          me as I began to notice the way the men were looking at my naked body, and I tearfully begged them to pull
          down my clothes. No one did so, however, and Stevens, pointing to me said: &quot;There boys, look at her
          bottom. You see how regularly the white skin is striped with long red weals? But there is not a drop of blood.
          That's what I call a prettily-whipped bottom. But the gal ain't got a bit of grit in her. Any nigger wench
          would have taken double the number of strokes without making half the noise. Now the other woman is a plucky
          one, she took her whippin' well.&quot; He then pulled up my drawers and tied the strings round my waist,
          saying with a laugh: &quot;This is the first time I've ever fixed up a woman's trousers, and it's the first
          time I've ever whipped women who wore trousers.&quot; 55</p>

        <p>Pulling down my clothes, he now loosened me from the ladder and led me, crying, sore and miserable, back to
          the veranda where Miss Dean was still lying on her side upon the couch with her hands over her face. He then
          went off to the other men, a few of whom I saw were engaged in work of some sort near the fence. But I was so
          thankful at having got out of their hands and sight that I did not particularly notice what they were doing. I
          thought they would soon go away and that all our troubles were over. I had quite forgotten that Stevens had
          said we would have to ride a rail for two hours after being whipped. Miss Dean looked mournfully at me. Her
          sweet face was very pale and her soft eyes were full of tears but the tears were not for herself, they were
          for me. She beckoned to me, and, when I went to her, she folded me in her arms, pressing me to her bosom.
          &quot;Oh! My poor, poor girl,&quot; she murmured in tones full of compassion. &quot;How I have felt for you!
          Your shrieks pierced my heart. Oh! The cruel, cruel man, to whip you so severely!&quot; (She seemed to have
          quite forgotten the shame and pain of her own whipping in her pity for me.) &quot;He did not whip me nearly so
          severely as he did you,&quot; I said. &quot;He gave me only a dozen strokes and no blood has come. But I could
          not help screaming. I am not so brave as you are.&quot; Then we kissed and cried and sympathized with each
          other, comparing notes as to our feelings while we had been on the ladder exposed to the eyes of the men.
          After a moment or two I put my hand under my petticoats and touched my smarting bottom, feeling the weals
          which had been raised on the flesh by the switch. They were exquisitely tender and I could hardly bear to
          touch them. &quot;Oh! Dear me!&quot; I wailed, &quot;How dreadfully sore I am. But you must be much
          sorer.&quot; 56</p>

        <p>&quot;I certainly am very sore,&quot; said Miss Dean, wiping her eyes. &quot;I can neither sit down nor lie
          on my back. My bottom is still bleeding, I think, and my pantalettes are sticking to my flesh. But, oh, oh!
          The awful exposure, and the shameful touch of the man's hand was worse than the whipping!&quot; she exclaimed,
          wringing her hands while the tears again began to trickle down her cheeks. I pressed her hand in sympathy, and
          she went on: &quot;Our sufferings are not over yet, Dorothy. Don't you remember that the man said we would
          have to ride a rail for two hours?&quot; I now did call to mind what Stevens had said about our riding a rail,
          but I was not much frightened at having to do so. Of course, I knew that it would be very uncomfortable-if not
          downright painful-to have to sit with a sore and smarting bottom on a rail for two hours. But that was all I
          thought about the matter at the moment. Ah! I little knew what a terrible torture riding a rail would prove to
          be! I don't know whether Miss Dean had any notion of what it actually was, but anyway she did not say a word
          more on the subject, and we stood, both of us being too sore to sit down in comfort, with our arms round each
          other, weeping silently and waiting miserably for the men to come for us. We had not long to wait. In a couple
          of minutes, four of the band came and, taking us by the arms, led us out of the veranda to the fence beside
          which the other men were standing, some of them holding pieces of rope in their hands. The fence was about
          five feet high and of the ordinary pattern, made of split rails, the upper edge of each rail being
          wedge-shaped and sharp. Stevens, with a cruel smile on his face, said: &quot;Now you are going to receive the
          rest of your punishment, a two-hour ride on the rail. I guess your bottoms must be very hot jest now, but
          they'll have plenty of time to cool while you are having your ride. And to prevent you from falling off your
          horses, well tie you on them. Get them ready, boys.&quot; 57</p>

        <p>I thought that we merely would be tied in a sitting posture on the fence with our clothes down. But I was
          soon undeceived! We were each seized by two men who held our arms while a third man raised our petticoats and
          pulled our drawers entirely off our legs. Then our skirts were held high above our waists so that the whole
          lower parts of our persons, both behind and before, were exposed to the lustful eyes of the horrid men. Since
          they had already seen our bottoms, they all crowded in front of us, gloating over the secret &quot;spots&quot;
          of our respective bodies, while we, crimson with shame greater than ever, struggled and wept and entreated the
          wretches to cover our nakedness. But they only laughed, and two or three of them put their hands on the
          &quot;spots.&quot; The touch of their fingers making us start and shrink with a horrible feeling of disgust.
          Stevens stopped them by saying: &quot;No, no, boys, you must not touch the prisoners, but you may look at them
          as much as you like.&quot; And the men did look, making remarks, speculating as to whether we were virgins or
          not, pointing the difference in the shape of our figures and observing the colour of the hair on our
          respective &quot;spots,&quot; while we blushed and cried with shame. You have seen my &quot;spot&quot; and
          know what it is like; there is nothing remarkable about it. But Miss Dean's &quot;spot&quot; was somewhat
          remarkable. I had never seen it before, and I could not help looking at it with astonishment. It was covered
          with a thick forest of glossy, darkbrown hair which extended some distance up her belly and descended between
          her thighs in curly locks nearly two inches long. The fissure was completely hidden and not a trace of the
          lips could be seen. One man, after a prolonged stare, exclaimed: &quot;By Gosh! I've never seen such a fleece
          between a woman's legs in my life! Darn me if she wouldn't have to be sheared before a man could get into
          her.&quot; The men roared with laughter at the remark, while Miss Dean groaned and writhed in the bitterness
          of her shame. 58</p>

        <p>After looking at our naked bodies for fully five minutes, the men went on with their work. A long piece of
          rope was passed several times round our bodies so that our arms and wrists were lashed closely to our sides.
          We then were lifted bodily up and, to my intense horror, seated astride one of the topmost rails of the fence,
          facing each other and about six feet apart. The rail passed between our naked thighs, and our bare bottoms
          rested on the sharp edge of it. On each side of the fence and close to it the men had driven stakes into the
          ground, and to these stakes our ankles ' were securely tied. When the men had fixed us in this painful
          position, they allowed our clothes to fall about our legs. Our nakedness was covered, but our torture had
          begun. Stevens looked at us with a grin on his face, saying: &quot;There now; you are properly mounted on your
          horses. We're done with you and we're all going away. But at the end of two hours one of us will come back and
          loosen you. And I reckon you'll both be mighty stiff after your ride.&quot; Then the band of lynchers took
          their departure, laughing and shouting coarse jokes which made us, even in our pain, grow hot with shame. The
          clatter of the horses' hoofs and the loud laughter of the men gradually died away in the distance. Then all
          was perfectly still. 59</p>

        <p>CHAPTER 6 On the rack; moral torture is allied to physical; I make the great decision of my life and consent
          to become Randolph's mistress; his revolting cynicism. It was a beautiful, calm, bright evening. The sun was
          just setting and the house, the garden and our two unfortunate selves were bathed in a flood of amber light At
          first I had entertained a faint hope that Martha would come back once the men had gone and would release us.
          However, she never came, and there did not seem to be the slightest chance of anyone else's coming to the
          house at that hour. Thus, escape being seen as impossible, I resigned myself to the thought that Miss Dean and
          I would be forced to undergo the whole of our dreadful punishment. From the first moment of our being placed
          astride the rail we had been suffering pain. Now it was increasing every minute. We did not speak to one
          another-our sufferings were too great!-so we just sat in silence with the tears, which we could not wipe off,
          trickling down our pale cheeks, while every now and then a shuddering sob or a groan of anguish would break
          from our parched lips. Since our legs were rather widely stretched apart, the rail was imbedded in the cleft
          between our thighs and the weight of our bodies forced the sharp edge deeply into the division between the
          cheeks of our bottoms. Consequently the most delicate part of our persons was hurt by the pressure. Just
          imagine our positions and think what it meant to individuals of the female sex! Miss Dean, throughout the
          whole time we were on the rail, bore her sufferings bravely. Alas, I, for my part, could not. As the minutes
          slowly parsed, the pain grew more and more excruciating. In addition, my bottom still was smarting and the
          weals on it still were throbbing. I felt as if the wedge-shaped rail were slowly splitting me. 60</p>

        <p>Sharp, lacerating pains darted through my loins and up my back. Since my ankles were tightly fastened to the
          stake, I could not alter my position in the slightest degree. If my arms had not been bound to my sides, I
          might have gained a little temporary ease by resting my hands on the rail and thus taking some of the weight
          off my bottom. But the men, in their devilish ingenuity, had taken care that we should not have even a
          moment's respite from our tortures. Even if we had fainted, we would not have fallen off the fence: the upper
          part of our bodies would have dropped either forward or backward, but our legs, tied to the stakes, would have
          remained straddled over the rail, and the sharp edge still would have remained between the cheeks of our
          bottoms. Before long, every nerve in my body was throbbing with agony. A cold dew of perspiration had broken
          out on my forehead. I groaned and writhed and twisted about, but the more I did so, the more firmly the sharp
          rail was imbedded in my tender cleft. I began to scream, and, but for the grace of God, might even have
          cursed. Miss Dean, meanwhile, was crying, and her face showed the anguish which she felt. However, she made no
          outcry. A few minutes more of agony slowly passed. Then I saw a man enter the lane and come towards the house.
          He was not one of the lynchers, so my heart bounded with joy. We should be released in a few moments! I
          redoubled my cries, begging him to come quickly to our assistance. However, he did not hurry himself in the
          least. He walked deliberately and slowly up the path, and, alas, when he got a little nearer, I saw that he
          was none other than Randolph. A few days previously I had hoped never to set eyes on him again. But now I was
          intensely delighted to see him. &quot;Oh, Mr. Randolph!&quot; I gasped out in a choking voice, with tears
          streaming down my cheeks. &quot;Take me down! Oh! Take me down quickly!&quot; 61</p>

        <p>He came close to the fence and stood looking down at Miss Dean and me. He had a smile on his face. &quot;Oh
          dear, Mr. Randolph!&quot; I again wailed. 'Take me down! Do be quick and take me down!&quot; But, to my
          horror, he did not move. &quot;Well,&quot; he said mockingly, &quot;if it isn't Miss Ruth Dean and Miss
          Dorothy Morton. This is what slave-running has brought you. And it is to me that you owe your present
          position. I let the 'white' people know of your doings, and you have been rightly and smartly punished. I told
          you, Dolly, that we should meet again, and we have met. I knew that the men were coming to pay you a visit
          this evening, so I came with them, and, though you did not see me, I saw both of you getting your bottoms
          whipped. I must say, Dolly, you squealed just like a pig being killed.&quot; He paused to laugh, and a
          sickening feeling of despair came over me. The cruel man, not content with having set the lynchers on us, had
          come to mock us in our agony. He continued: &quot;I am afraid that your bottoms- especially yours, Miss
          Dean-must be very tender after the smart switching, and I am sure that you both must be extremely
          uncomfortable on your present seats. The edges are sharp, and I have no doubt that they are pressing sorely on
          a certain delicate 'spot' between your thighs.&quot; Miss Dean's face was working with pain and her eyes were
          full of tears. But, when she heard Randolph's coarse and indecent words, she put aside her suffering and was
          consumed with indignation. Her pale cheeks grew red. Looking at me, she said in a quavering voice:
          &quot;Dorothy, do you know this boor?&quot; Randolph answered for me: &quot;Oh yes she does! Miss Morton and I
          once were great friends. But we had a little tiff one day and she told me to go away. Is that not the case,
          Dolly?&quot; 62</p>

        <p>I hated the man, but at that moment the dreadful pain which I was suffering overpowered every other feeling.
          &quot;Yes! Yes! That is the case!&quot; I exclaimed fretfully. &quot;But don't stand there talking! Take us
          down at once!&quot; Randolph smiled, but did not make a move to release us. &quot;Oh! Oh!&quot; I shrieked
          with pain, enraged at his utter callousness. &quot;How can you stand there and watch two poor women suffering
          agony? Oh! Why don't you release us? Have you no mercy or pity?&quot; &quot;I am not a merciful man,&quot; he
          replied coolly. &quot;I am a Southerner. As a rule I have no pity for abolitionists when they get into trouble
          for interfering with our slaves.&quot; Then, grinning lasciviously, he added: &quot;But I don't mind making an
          exception in your case, Dolly. I will take you down if you will promise to come and live with me.&quot; Upon
          hearing what he said, Miss Dean again fixed her eyes on me. She said earnestly: &quot;Oh, Dorothy! Don't
          listen to the man! He is a cruel scoundrel to try to take advantage of your sufferings. But be brave, dear.
          Don't give way. I am suffering as much as-if not more than-you are, but I would not accept release on such
          disgraceful terms.&quot; Randolph laughed scornfully. &quot;I have not the least intention of offering the
          terms to you, Miss Dean,&quot; he said. &quot;As far as I am concerned, you may sit on the rail till the two
          hours are over. The view I had of your naked charms did not tempt me in the slightest. You have no figure. You
          are quite straight up and down. Your bottom is too narrow, your thighs are too small and your legs are too
          thin. I like a woman to have a broad bottom, plump thighs and good legs, such as Dorothy has.&quot; &quot;Oh!
          You hateful man!&quot; exclaimed Miss Dean angrily-for, after all, she was a woman, and no woman likes to hear
          her charms, whatever they may be, spoken of in disparaging terms. 63</p>

        <p>But Randolph ignored her. &quot;Now then, Dolly,&quot; he chuckled. &quot;You have heard what I said. Do you
          intend to come home with me tonight?&quot; The coarse way he put the question shocked me, so I tried to pluck
          up a little spirit. I partly succeeded. &quot;No, no, I won't go home with you,&quot; I said. But, I fear, my
          tone of voice was far from determined. &quot;Very well then,&quot; replied he. &quot;Stay where you are. You
          have an hour and a half more to sit on your perch. By that time you'll be in a terrible state between the
          legs. And you'll be half-dead with pain. Rather a dreadful prospect, isn't it?&quot; Alas, it was! I moaned
          and shuddered at the thought of the long period of agony before me. Again I piteously entreated him to take me
          down. He made no answer, but coolly lit a cigar and began to smoke. Then, leaning against the middle of the
          rail, he looked first to his right at Miss Dean, then to his left at me. His physiognomy was a study in
          perfect unconcern as we writhed, wept and groaned in anguish-and as the sharp edge of the rail pressed harder
          and harder against the tender flesh between the cheeks of our bottoms. For a few minutes more, I bore the
          pain, which was growing more and more intense. Then I gave way utterly. I could no longer endure the anguish.
          I said to myself: &quot;What does anything matter, so long as I can escape from this terrible torture?! I
          can't bear it for another hour and a half I I'll go raving mad, or die!&quot; No doubt it was weak of me, but
          I was in a half-fainting state, and, as I have told you before, I am physically and morally a coward.
          &quot;Oh!&quot; I cried. &quot;Oh! Take me down! Take me down at once, and I promise to go home with
          you!&quot; When Miss Dean heard me promise to go with Randolph, she said: &quot;Don't! Oh, don't go with him
          Dorothy! Don't wreck your life! Try to 64</p>

        <p>bear your sufferings! They soon will be over! If I were you I would rather die than yield my body to the
          man.&quot; &quot;You are not she, Miss Dean,&quot; Randolph said curtly. Then, turning to me, he asked:
          &quot;Have you quite made up your mind, Dolly?&quot; And, so saying, he touched his hand to the knot of the
          rope binding my arms. &quot;Yes! Yes!&quot; I cried impatiently. &quot;Oh! Do be quick and release me!&quot;
          &quot;Oh, Dorothy!&quot; sighed Miss Dean in a sorrowful tone. &quot;Oh, you poor girl! I pity you! You do not
          know the horror and shame which lie before you!&quot; Randolph soon untied the ropes which fastened my arms
          and ankles. Then, putting his arms around my waist, he lifted me off the rail, carried me into the veranda and
          laid me, limp and faint, on the couch. I was stiff and sore and aching from head to foot, but I was not
          suffering much pain. And, oh, the intense relief to find myself no longer astride the sharp rail! When I was
          situated comfortably, Randolph fetched me a glass of water, which I drank thirstily, for my mouth was parched
          and I was quite feverish from the torture which I had undergone. Then, when I had recovered a little, I
          thought of Miss Dean and I asked Randolph to release her. However, he was very bitterly set against her, and
          would hear nothing of my pleas. It was not until after I had begged for her with all the pathos at my command
          that he finally consented to release her before we went away. &quot;Now, Dolly,&quot; he said, &quot;I'll go
          for the buggy. I left it just around the corner of the lane. I shan't be gone long, so you lie here quietly
          until I come back.&quot; Then he added meaningfully: &quot;You had better not attempt to escape, for the men
          still are somewhere in the neighbourhood and if they see you they'll put you back on the rail.&quot; So
          saying, he took his leave. 65</p>

        <p>The thought of escape never entered my head. At that moment I was so weak and frightened that all my senses
          were in a half-torpid state. I did not fully realize the horrors which lay ahead of me, and I lay languidly on
          the couch, thinking only that it was so delightful to be free at last from pain. Presently Randolph drove up
          with the buggy and, after hitching the horse to the garden gate, came to the couch, &quot;Now then,
          Dolly,&quot; he said to me, &quot;come along. Never mind your things. My women can supply you with everything
          necessary for the night, and I will send for your trunks tomorrow morning. Can you walk to the buggy, or shall
          I carry you?&quot; I replied that I could walk. But, on attempting to do so, I found myself so shaky and stiff
          that I could barely put one foot before the other. Noticing how feeble I was, Randolph lifted me up in his
          arms and carried me to the buggy. Then he placed me inside and wrapped a rug around my knees. I reminded him
          of his promise to free Miss Dean before we left, and he dutifully went to the fence and untied her bonds.
          However, he did not take the trouble to help her off her painful perch; the poor creature was forced to climb
          from the rail without assistance of any sort. Miss Dean was weak, pale and suffering. Her feebleness was such
          that she had to lean against the fence for support. But her thoughts still were for me. &quot;Don't go with
          that man, Dorothy,&quot; she said again, her tone urgent and earnest. &quot;Never mind your promise. It was
          extracted from you by torture, so you are not morally obliged to keep it. Stay with me.&quot; I did not want
          to go with Randolph, and I would have been only too glad to stay with her. But my cowardice ruled the day.
          Afraid of being placed once more astride the rail, I could only cry out feebly: &quot;Oh, I must go with him,
          my dear friend. I am in his power.&quot; &quot;Yes, indeed you are,&quot; Randolph observed. &quot;And if you
          were to attempt to break your promise you would very soon find yourself back 66</p>

        <p>'in the saddle.'&quot; Then, addressing Miss Dean, he went on: &quot;Remember, Ruth, what the men told you.
          If you are not out of the state before forty-eight hours have expired, you will receive another visit from
          'Judge Lynch.'&quot; He then got into the buggy beside me, and, as he did so, I shrank as far away from him as
          possible, hating him and despising myself even more. Randolph touched the horse with his whip and we drove
          off, leaving Miss Dean standing with drooping head by the fence. After we had gone a short distance, I looked
          back and saw her lonely figure still in the same position. She did not move, and I kept my eyes fixed upon her
          until the buggy turned the corner of the lane. Then I sank back on the seat and, covering my face with my
          hands, wept bitterly. I had parted with the only friend I had in the world. 67</p>

        <p>CHAPTER 7 At Randolph's house; I make Dinah's acquaintance; her sympathy for me, and her contempt for
          unsophisticated &quot;whites&quot;; my attempts to escape are frustrated. Randolph did not say a word to me,
          but just let me cry away, which was the best thing he could have done at the moment. The buggy, drawn by a
          fast trotter, rolled rapidly along the road, and, since Randolph's plantation was only three miles distant, we
          soon reached the gates of the avenue leading to the house. The gates were thrown open by two Negroes and we
          entered the avenue, which was about a quarter of a mile long, shaded throughout its length with tall trees. In
          a few minutes we arrived at the house, a very large and handsome building; consisting of a central part, with
          a cupola on top, and wings on either side. In front was a broad terrace sloping down to a lawn flanked with
          well-kept beds of beautiful flowers. Several Negroes were on the terrace, waiting to receive their master,
          and, when he pulled up the horse at the door, the men came forward and took charge of the animal. The wide
          door of the house was opened. Then Randolph, lifting me out of the buggy, carried me through a spacious hall
          into a handsomely furnished room and placed me on a couch. &quot;There, Dolly,&quot; he said, smiling down at
          me. &quot;You are safe from the lynchers now.&quot; He next rang a bell, which immediately was answered by a
          goodlooking quadroon woman about thirty-five years of age. She was very tall, stout and broad shouldered, and
          was dressed in a well-fitting print frock, with white apron, collar and cuffs. She had very black, glossy,
          wavy hair, and on her head she wore a smart cap. The woman looked hard at me, but there was not the least
          expression of surprise on her face. &quot;Dinah,&quot; said her master, &quot;this lady has met with an
          accident. Carry her up to the pink room and attend to her. See that she has everything she wants and take
          great care of her. Do you understand?&quot; 68</p>

        <p>&quot;Yes, Massa,&quot; she replied. Turning to me, Randolph said: &quot;I am going to dinner now, but Dinah
          will look after you and I think that you had better let her put you to bed. You are quite feverish. You shall
          not be disturbed tonight,&quot; he added meaningfully. I understood the significance of the last words, but I
          made no remark and a blush dyed my cheeks. I was still dazed and stupid. The rapid succession of painful and
          startling events had been too much for me. Dinah came to the sofa, and, lifting me in her strong arms as if I
          had been a baby, carried me out of the room and up a broad flight of stairs to a most luxuriously furnished
          bedroom, where she laid me on the bed. Then closing the door, she came back to the bedside and looked at me
          with a kind, motherly expression on her pleasant face. &quot;I know who you is, Missy,&quot; she said,
          &quot;you is one of the good Northern ladies who keeps the 'unnergroun' station.' All de cullud folks in dese
          parts has heard of you. But it was none of dem dat set de lynchers on you. I know de lynchers has been after
          you today, honey. What did dey do to you? Did dey ride you on a rail? Dey offen does dat to ablishinists.
          Don't mind tellin' me all about it, little Miss. I'se fond of you for what yo've done for de runaways.&quot;
          The woman's sympathy was most comforting to me, so I told her all that had been done to Miss Dean and myself.
          &quot;Oh! you poor young lady! I'se so very sorry for you,&quot; she exclaimed, in tones full of pity.
          &quot;You mus' be drefful sore. But I will bathe you an' make you as comfortable as I can, an' den you mus' go
          to bed.&quot; It was rather dark, so she lit the lamps and drew the curtains. She then left the room,
          returning in a few minutes with a can of hot water. &quot;Now, honey,&quot; she said tenderly, &quot;I'll fix
          you up.&quot; 69</p>

        <p>Dinah undressed me to my chemise. Then, asking me to lie on my face, she rolled up the garment, and, after
          separating my legs a little, examined my body. &quot;I see dat dose horrid men gave you twelve strokes with de
          switch,&quot; she observed. &quot;De weals is quite plain on your poor bottom, Missy, an' you is all bruised
          an' marked between de thighs where the rail hurt you.&quot; She then sponged my bottom with cold water and
          gently rubbed the weals with some soft stuff, saying: &quot;Dis is possum fat, Missy. It will take the smart
          out of de weals. We always uses possum fat to take away de sting of a whipping.&quot; The stuff certainly did
          seem to make my bottom feel easier. &quot;What a bootiful figure you've got,&quot; she continued. &quot;And
          such pretty legs. And such a lubly white skin. I'se never seen such a white one in my life.&quot; When she had
          fixed my bottom, she turned me over onto my back and fomented with warm water my &quot;spot&quot; and the
          parts adjacent, uttering all the time expressions of pity for me and abusing the lynchers, whom she called a
          pack of &quot;mean white trash.&quot; (It is a curious fact that the slaves in the South used to have a
          contempt for white people who did not own a Negro. I may also here say that Dinah never knew that it was her
          master who had set the lynchers on us.) Since my parts were very tender and also a good deal swollen, Dinah's
          fomentation gave me great relief. When she had finished bathing the sore &quot;spot,&quot; she went to a
          drawer, which, to my surprise, I saw was filled with all sorts of feminine undergarments. Taking out a lace
          trimmed nightdress, she brought it to me. Then, removing my chemise, she put the nightgown on me and made me
          get into bed. She then went away, but soon returned with a tray on which were dishes, plates and a small
          bottle of champagne. She placed a small table by the bedside, and, spreading a cloth, laid out the good things
          she had brought. 70</p>

        <p>&quot;Now, honey,&quot; she said, &quot;here is a nice little dinner. You must try and eat a bit, and drink
          some of dis wine. It will do you good.&quot; Since I had been a teetotaller all my life, I did not want the
          wine. I asked Dinah to get me a cup of tea. She soon did so. Then I propped myself up in the bed, taking care
          to press as little as possible on my bottom, and, since I was feeling very faint, I began to eat and was able
          to make a very fair meal, forgetting the past for the moment, and not thinking of the future. While I was
          having my supper, Dinah talked to me freely, but always with perfect respect. The fact of my having been
          indecently whipped by a band of men had not lowered me the least in her estimation. To her, I was still a
          white lady from the North, while she was only a slave. She informed me with an air of pride that she was the
          housekeeper and had twenty female servants under her. Then she gave me some particulars about herself. She had
          been born on the plantation and had never been more than twenty miles from it in all her life. She once had
          had a husband, but was now a widow without a child. She further informed me in a most matter-of-course way
          that she often had been whipped. When she had cleared away the dinner things, she brushed my hair-it was the
          first time that I had ever had such a thing done for me since I had become an adult woman. Then she put a bell
          on the table beside the bed, and, after turning down the lamp, bade me good night and left the room. When I
          woke the next morning the hands of the handsome Dresden china clock on the mantelpiece pointed to half-past
          eight o'clock. Sitting up in bed, I looked about me with the puzzled feeling one always experiences on first
          waking in a strange place. Then my brain cleared, and I vividly remembered all the dreadful incidents of the
          previous day: the horrible exposure of my most secret parts before a number of rough men; the ignominious and
          painful whipping; the agonizing ride on the rail. I shuddered. Next I thought of Randolph, 71</p>

        <p>and of the promise which I had given him. He might come to me at any moment! I felt my cheeks flush, and, in
          a sudden, unthinking impulse, I jumped out of bed and ran to the door to lock it. But there was no key. Then
          it struck me that locking the door-even if I had been able to do so-would not save me. I was in the man's
          power and would have to submit to him sooner or later. So I crept back to bed again, lying trembling and
          wondering whether he would do the horrid deed some time during the day or wait until night time. At nine
          o'clock Dinah came in with a cup of tea for me, bringing with her a letter from Randolph saying that he had
          been unexpectedly called to Richmond on urgent business which probably would detain him four or five days. He
          said also that he had made arrangements for my trunks to be brought to Woodlands, and he had given orders to
          all the servants that they were to look upon me as their mistress. He finished the note by telling me that
          Dinah knew where everything was, and that she would take good care of me. Feeling very thankful for my
          temporary respite, I drank the tea and lay down again. Presently a smart young quadroon chambermaid brought in
          a large tin bath which she filled with water. After laying out towels and all the other articles necessary for
          my toilet, she left the room. I had my bath and, while drying myself, looked at my bottom in the mirror,
          finding that the weals had gone down considerably. But they still showed in long red stripes on my skin and
          they still were tender to the touch. I also was still very sore between the legs, where the rail had bruised
          the flesh-in fact, it was a week before all the marks and bruises on my body had entirely disappeared. Tears
          rose to my eyes and my heart swelled with rage and bitterness as I gazed at the traces of the shameful
          punishment which had been inflicted on me. Dinah came back and helped me to dress. She also arranged my hair.
          Then she showed me to a snug, well-furnished room where I sat down (my bottom was still rather tender) to
          breakfast, waited on by two pretty quadroon girls who gazed at me curiously with their big, soft, black eyes,
          but who treated me with the utmost deference. 72</p>

        <p>Just as I had finished breakfast, Dinah came to inform me that my trunks had arrived; she told me also that
          she had heard that Miss Dean and Martha were going to start that evening for Richmond on their way North. Oh!
          how I wished I were going with them. Then the idea of escape flashed across my mind, and I determined to try
          and get away from Woodlands. If I could get to Miss Dean, she would be delighted to see me and to know that I
          had returned to her as pure as when I left. Moreover, she would take me back with her to Philadelphia. Filled
          with new hope, I went up to my room. I was glad to be able to change my clothes. Dressing in clean garments
          from head to foot, I put on my hat and went down into the hall. Finding Dinah standing near the open door, I
          told her that I was going out for a walk. &quot;Oh Missy,&quot; she said, &quot;I know what you is thinkin'
          of. You wants to get away to Miss Dean. But, oh, honey, you can't. De Massa has give strict orders to de men
          at de gate not to let you out, an' all de place is watched. You can't get away nohow.&quot; My hopes of escape
          were dashed to the ground. I felt utterly miserable. Throwing myself on a seat, I wept bitterly while Dinah
          hovered about me, looking sympathetic but saying nothing. I saw at once that, if I could not reach Miss Dean
          before she started, all chance for me was gone, for, even if I managed to get away from Woodlands, I had
          neither money nor a place to go. Moreover, I had been warned by the lynchers to leave Virginia in forty-eight
          hours. If they caught me wandering about-which they would be sure to dothey would ride me on a rail again or
          whip me, perhaps both. The prospect was too awful to contemplate, so with a heavy heart I gave up all thought
          of leaving Wood-Sands. I would have to remain and submit to my fate when the time came. 73</p>

        <p>After a few minutes I grew calmer. Then Dinah, with the intention of diverting my thoughts, asked if I would
          come and see the house. I answered in the affirmative, and she showed me all over the place, from the attic to
          the kitchen. It was a very large mansion, beautifully furnished throughout; it had long corridors and two
          flights of stairs, one at the front and one at the back; there were twenty bedrooms, each decorated in a
          different style, plus several sitting rooms and boudoirs, a spacious dining room and an immense drawing room;
          there also was a billiard table and a large library well filled with books of all sorts. I never before had
          been in such a grand house, nor had I seen such splendid furniture. The pictures, though, in some of the rooms
          made me blush. There were twenty female servants-slaves, of course-living in the house. All were dressed alike
          in well-fitting pink-print frocks with white aprons, caps, collars and cuffs. They all wore neat,
          well-polished shoes and white cotton stockings, and everyone of them looked trim and clean. In fact, they were
          obliged to be always tidy and properly dressed, any slovenliness being punished. The cooks and kitchen
          servants were black or mulatto women, but all the parlour maids and housemaids were young quadroons or
          octoroons from eighteen to twenty-five years of age. All of them were pretty, while two or three of the
          octoroons were really quite handsome and so light in colour that they might easily have passed as white girls
          anywhere except in the South. (People there can at once detect the least trace of black blood in a man or
          woman.) Some of them had full, voluptuous-looking figures, and, since none wore stays, the rounded contours of
          their bosoms were plainly outlined under their thin bodices. There were several children of both sexes about
          the place, but no male servants lived in the house. When Dinah had shown me everything that was to be seen in
          the establishment, she left me and I went out into the grounds. They were extensive and beautifully kept.
          There were flower gardens, fruit and 74</p>

        <p>kitchen gardens, shrubberies and hot houses. The whole place was surrounded by high iron railings, the only
          means of exit being the gate at the entrance to the avenue. I wandered about listlessly, but I noticed that
          the men who were at work about the grounds kept a watch on my movements. I walked down to the gate, and, just
          to see if I was really a prisoner, I tried to open it. Two men instantly came out of the lodge and one of them
          said civilly: &quot;You can't go out, Missy. De gate is locked, by de Massa's order.&quot; I then returned to
          the house and went up to my grand bedroom, all pink and white and gold, with two large windows looking out
          onto the gardens at the back. It was partly furnished as a sitting room, with a comfortable sofa and easy
          chairs, a round table, and a large well-fitted writing cabinet. Drawing an easy chair to one of the windows, I
          sat down and had a long think. I thought what a cruel man Randolph was to have betrayed us to the lynchers and
          then to have taken advantage of my agony to extract that promise from me. Oh! Why had I not sufficient
          fortitude to bear the pain! If I had refused to accept release on the shameful terms which he had offered, I
          should in a few hours have been on my way to Richmond with Miss Dean! I thought of her, and contrasted her
          position with mine. She was all right, except for the whipping, and in a couple of days would be safe at home
          in Philadelphia, still in possession of her virgin treasure-while I would be at Woodlands, a prisoner in the
          hands of a man who had shown himself to be utterly unscrupulous. And what was to become of me afterwards?
          &quot;Oh dear! Oh dear!&quot; I said to myself. &quot;How I wish I had never persuaded Miss Dean to let me
          come to Virginia with her!&quot; The morning passed, and at one o'clock Dinah came to tell me that lunch was
          ready. I went downstairs and managed to have something to eat. Then I betook myself to the library, where I
          remained for the rest of 75</p>

        <p>the afternoon trying to divert my thoughts by reading a novel At seven o'clock I sat down to a dainty,
          well-cooked little dinner-a better dinner than I ever had seen, frankly, since Miss Dean always lived very
          plainly. The two quadroon parlour maids, whose names were Lucy and Kate, waited on me, while Dinah, as
          &quot;Butler,&quot; overlooked them. Dinah had the key to everything and was entirely trusted by her master.
          She offered me champagne, claret and bottled ale, but I refused them all. However, I made a fair meal, for I
          was a healthy girl and my appetite asserted itself in spite of the depressing nature of the position I was in
          at the moment. When dinner was over, I went into one of the smaller sitting rooms where the lamps had been
          lighted, the curtains drawn and everything made snug for me. But the evening seemed very long, and I felt very
          lonely. I should have liked Dinah's company, for her quaint talk would have amused me a little. But I did not
          think that it would be quite correct for me to send for her, and she, I suppose, did not think it right to
          intrude upon me. So I did not see her until I went up to my room, when she came to brush my hair and to help
          me undress. 76</p>

        <p>CHAPTER 8 News arrives that the &quot;Massa&quot; is returning; my virginity is to be sacrificed; fears and
          dread; I am given a scented bath; tortured in the tyrant's bed; the pain and horror of the
          &quot;wedding-night&quot;; the &quot;lust of his eyes&quot;; the terror of his tearing, iron-made tool. Four
          days passed in the quiet way narrated in the preceding chapter. On the fifth morning of my captivity, when
          Dinah came in with my usual cup of tea, she informed me that she had received a letter from her master-she
          could read, but not write-telling her that he would be home at seven o'clock to dinner and that she was to
          take care that it was a good one. I sat up in bed, looking blankly at Dinah and feeling a sinking sensation at
          my heart, for, though I had known that the fatal moment would come, I was startled at hearing that it was
          close at hand. I got up, had my bath and dressed myself mechanically, then went downstairs. But I could not
          eat any breakfast, though I thirstily drank two cups of coffee. All day long, I was restless and
          uncomfortable. I roamed about the great house with a sort of feeling that I was in a dream and would soon
          wake. Sometimes I would sit down on a chair with my mind quite blank. Then, in another moment, the thought of
          what was going to be done to me would strike my brain with a sudden shock that sent the blood to my cheeks. I
          dreaded the ordeal before me, morally as well as physically. Even a newly-wedded bride on the day of her
          marriage feels a little shame and fear at the thought of what her husband will do to her at night. But what
          could I do?- The afternoon wore slowly away, and, at five o'clock, I was sitting listlessly in my room when
          Dinah came in followed by one of the chambermaids carrying a bathtub. Placing it in the middle of the room,
          the girl filled it with warm water. Then she went away, but Dinah remained. 77</p>

        <p>Since I had taken my bath in the morning, I could not understand why the girl had again filled the tub- and
          with hot water too. I was not in the habit of bathing in hot water. &quot;I don't want a bath, Dinah,&quot; I
          said. &quot;No, Missy, I knows you don't, you is bootiful clean. But I'se had orders in de letters from de
          Massa to give you a scented bath. I must obey his orders, whatever dey is, or he will whip me. Now den, honey,
          you'll let me give you de bath.&quot; I flushed with a strong feeling of indignation. I also felt deeply
          humiliated. The victim was to be bathed and perfumed before the sacrifice! However, Dinah had to obey orders,
          so I told her that she might bathe me. She evidently was relieved, and at once began to prepare the
          &quot;scented bath,&quot; First she poured some fluid from a phial into the water; next she threw in a
          quantity of white powder, which had a delicate perfume of roses; then she stirred the water until the powder
          was completely dissolved. (I found out afterwards that the fluid and the powder were Turkish preparations used
          by the ladies of a harem to impart a softness and gloss to their skins.) When everything was ready, she
          undressed me. Then, making me stand up in the bath, she sponged me all over with the warm, perfumed water, at
          the same time praising the symmetry and plumpness of my figure and the whiteness of my skin. When she had
          finished bathing me, she dried me with soft, warm towels, then rubbed me with her hands from head to foot and
          with her fingers gently kneaded my breasts and arms, also my bottom, thighs and legs, until my flesh seemed to
          become firmer and my skin smoother and more velvety than usual. She then began to dress me, putting on my
          nicest things. She first put on me a lace-trimmed chemise with blue ribbons on the shoulders, then my finest
          drawers with deep lace frilling and bows of pink ribbon 78</p>

        <p>at the knees. Next she drew on my legs a pair of white silk stockings, fastening them above my knees with
          dark blue satin garters with silver buckles. Then she cased my feet in my neatest shoes, put on my nicest
          petticoats and laced me tightly in my stays. Finally she put on me my prettiest white frock. Then she brushed
          my hair and arranged it most elaborately. She was delighted with my appearance and, after turning me around
          two or three times, exclaimed: &quot;Oh Missy! You is a bootiful young lady for true. De Massa will be pleased
          when he sees you.&quot; Dinah knew that she had bathed, perfumed and dressed me for the sacrifice, but she did
          not understand what a dreadful thing it would be to me. She was not a virtuous woman herself, and her ideas,
          like those of most slave women, were very loose on the subject of feminine virtue. Besides, I think that she
          considered me a lucky young lady to have attracted the notice of &quot;De Massa,&quot; who in her eyes was a
          very exalted personage indeed. Now that I was dressed, she suggested that I go to the drawing room so as to be
          in readiness to receive the master on his return. Accordingly I went down to the great room, which had been
          brilliantly lighted, and seated myself on a sofa. I had become dully resigned to my fate, but my heart was
          heavy as I waited in the gorgeous apartment for the man who was going to rob me of my virginity. If I had had
          the slightest liking for him I should not have felt the thing so much. But I did not like him. I hated him.
          Presently I heard the sound of wheels on the terrace. Then I heard the hall door being opened and shut. He had
          arrived! My heart began to flutter, though not with the pleasurable anticipation of a young girl wafting for
          her lover. But Randolph did not make his appearance, so I supposed that he had gone straight to his own room
          to change his travelling garments. Such was the case. In a short time he came into the drawing room, dressed
          in evening clothes. 79</p>

        <p>I rose from my seat. He came to me, took both my hands in his and kissed me hotly on the lips, making me
          shrink and tremble. Then, holding me at arms' length, he looked at me from head to foot in a critical way, as
          if he were appraising my charms, while I stood with flaming cheeks and downcast eyes. &quot;You are looking
          very charming, Dolly,&quot; he said. &quot;The frock you are wearing becomes you, but in future you must
          always put on a lownecked dress for dinner.&quot; He already considered me his property! &quot;I have not got
          one,&quot; I murmured, without looking up. &quot;Well, you soon shall have more than one,&quot; he observed,
          laughing and patting me on the; cheek. &quot;Now tell me. Have you been comfortable during my absence? Has
          Dinah taken good care of you? Have the servants been attentive?&quot; I did not answer the first part of his
          question, for, though my body had been comfortable after it had recovered from the first severe effects of the
          punishment, my mind had been extremely uncomfortable the whole time. I replied: &quot;Dinah has taken very
          good care of me, and the servants have been most attentive. &quot;So much the better for them. If they had
          not, I would have made all their bottoms smart, from Dinah downwards,&quot; he observed coolly. His words
          jarred me. I thought that he need not have said anything about the women's bottoms. But what could I say?- He
          next asked two or three other questions, which I answered, Then one of the parlour maids announced dinner and
          we went into the big dining room. The table had been beautifully decorated with flowers and fruit. The glass,
          linen and other appointments were of the finest description, and the great sideboard of old, polished mahogany
          glittered with massive 80</p>

        <p>silver plate which had been in Randolph's family for generations. The dinner was of many courses, with all
          sorts of dishes which I had never heard of, and it was accompanied by wines whose names also were new to me.
          Randolph talked away gaily, eating heartily and drinking a bottle of champagne. I, being nervous and
          depressed, hardly ate anything. I could only answer in monosyllables, and I blushed whenever I happened to
          catch his eye. I was thinking constantly of the dreadful thing he was going to do to me that night. In order
          (I suppose) to cheer me up, he filled my glass with champagne and insisted that I drink it. But the wine only
          went to my head and made me giddy without exhilarating me in the least. When he saw the effect which the
          liquor had on me he did not give me any more. When dinner was over and he had smoked a cigar, we went back to
          the drawing room. Seating himself comfortably in an easy chair, he continued to talk, not taking any notice of
          my silence or making any remark about my downcast looks. He was in high spirits, induced, I suppose, by the
          thought that he soon would be in possession of my virgin body. He told me that he had heard that Miss Dean had
          got safely home to Philadelphia, and he added with a laugh: &quot;I don't think that the prim Quaker will ever
          again take to running an 'underground station.' She got a real smart whipping and she will always carry the
          marks of it on her bottom. But you won't be marked in the least, Dolly, as your skin was not cut.&quot; I
          shuddered, and my bottom seemed to tingle as I thought of the whipping. At ten o'clock he rose from his seat
          and said jocularly: &quot;Now, Dolly, since this is our wedding night, we'll go to bed early. Come
          upstairs.&quot; I blushed furiously and began to cry. After all, I could not resign myself quietly to my
          unhappy fate. I thought that I had become resigned, but 81</p>

        <p>now that the moment had arrived, all my feelings of modesty rose in revolt against the sacrifice of my
          maidenhead. I made a last despairing appeal for mercy. &quot;Oh! Mr. Randolph!&quot; I exclaimed. &quot;Will
          you not spare me?&quot; His countenance grew dark, he frowned and a hard look came into his eyes. &quot;Don't
          be a fool, Dolly,&quot; he answered harshly, &quot;You gave me your promise, and I thought that the whole
          affair was settled. Come along.&quot; &quot;Oh, do not hold me to my promise!&quot; I wailed. &quot;You know
          that when I made it I was half-mad with pain. Oh! Do let me go away from your house.&quot; &quot;Now listen to
          me,&quot; he said in cold, incisive tones. &quot;I am not going to stand any nonsense. You are completely in
          my power, and I don't intend to spare you, as you call it. If you do not come upstairs and submit quietly,
          I'll have you carried up by four of the women, and I will make them hold you down upon the bed, so that I
          shall be able to do what I like to you at my ease. Now will you come quietly, or must you be carried up and
          held?&quot; My appeal for mercy had failed, and I was thoroughly frightened by his threats. To be held down by
          four women while the deed was being done would only add to my shame. The very idea of such a thing made me
          shiver with horror. Resistance being useless, there was nothing left for me but to submit. &quot;I will go
          quietly.&quot; I sobbed in a low voice, with the tears trickling down my cheeks. (Oh! how wretched I felt as I
          said those words!) &quot;That's right,&quot; he said. Then taking me by the hand he led me up to my room. The
          shaded lamps had all been lit, so the apartment was filled with a bright, soft light. I at once noticed that a
          large bath towel had been 82</p>

        <p>spread over the silken coverlet of the bed, and that a nightshirt of his had been placed on one of the
          pillows. He closed the door. Then, turning to me, he said: &quot;I am glad that you have come to your senses.
          I hate struggling with a woman, but I would have had my way in the end. Now continue to be sensible, and let
          me do whatever I like to you, without making any more remonstrances. First of all, I am going to undress you
          with my own hands. I like undressing a pretty girl.&quot; He did the work in a way that showed it was by no
          means the first time he had stripped a woman. Making me stand in front of the mirror, he unfastened my dress,
          and, taking it off, threw it on a chair. Then he deftly unlaced my stays and removed them, thus exposing the
          upper part of my bosom, which I endeavoured to hide by crossing my arms over it. Next he loosed the strings of
          my petticoats, letting them fall to the floor and making me step out of them. Then, kneeling down, he took off
          my shoes, after which he slipped his hands up my legs, unbuckled my garters and pulled off my stockings. Now,
          putting both his hands under my chemise, he untied my drawers and drew them off my legs. As his hands strayed
          over my body and limbs while he was thus slowly stripping me, I shivered, but I offered no resistance. It
          would have been of no avail. He had determined to do the deed in his own way, so there would have been no use
          in my resisting. Nothing remained now but my chemise, and that he soon pulled off over my head, leaving me
          standing nude before him. As I saw my whole figure reflected in the mirror, I could not help uttering a little
          cry of shame, and I instinctively covered the &quot;spot&quot; with both my hands, while my face and neck and
          the upper part of my bosom became scarlet. I shut my eyes', but the tears forced their way between my closed
          eyelids and trickled down my cheeks. 83</p>

        <p>Randolph now turned me around, looking at me on every side, and holding my hands so that I could not screen
          any part of my body. But he did not feel me: when he had sufficiently gratified the lust of his eyes, he
          lifted me up in his arms, carried me to the bed, and laid me down upon it on my back. Covering the
          &quot;spot&quot; with one hand, and with the other hiding my scarlet face, I lay trembling while he quietly
          undressed himself and put on his nightshirt. I hoped that he would extinguish the lights, but he did not.
          Getting up on the bed beside me, he removed my hand from my face. Then, clasping my naked body in his arms, he
          kissed my lips, eyes and cheeks, saying: &quot;Now, my-dear little girl, I've got you at last.&quot; It was
          the first time he had made use of a tender word to me that night. While stripping me he had not spoken a word,
          but had treated me as if I had been merely a mannequin. After kissing me, he proceeded to gratify his sense of
          touch. Laying both his hands on my bosom, he played with my breasts, squeezing them, tickling them and
          kneading the flesh with his fingers. Then, bending his head, he took one of my nipples in his mouth and
          nibbled at it with his teeth. Uttering a startled cry, I shrank away from him, plucking my nipple out of his
          mouth. &quot;Keep still, whatever I do,&quot; he said sharply. Then, taking my other nipple between his lips,
          he sucked it and rolled his tongue over it as if it had been a bit of candy. I forced myself to lie still,
          and, after a moment or two, he let go my nipple. Then he stroked my belly and ran his hands several times over
          each of my thighs. Finally, separating my legs a little, he touched the &quot;spot,&quot; twining his fingers
          in the hair and pulling it rather hard. Now he inserted the tip of his forefinger between the lips, making me
          squirm and quiver from head to foot -but not with pleasure-and 84</p>

        <p>extracting from me a stifled shriek: &quot;Oh! Oh! Don't do that!&quot; I exclaimed. &quot;Oh! Do take your
          hand away!&quot; &quot;Don't be silly,&quot; he said. &quot;You'll feel something else there in a minute or
          two.&quot; With a strong effort I controlled myself and lay quiet again. Turning me over onto my face, he
          looked at my bottom, saying: &quot;The marks of the whipping are not quite gone. There are still a few faint
          pink lines on your skin.&quot; Then he played with my bottom in all sorts of ways, stroking it, pinching it
          all over, gently spanking it and squeezing the flesh with both his hands. He finished up by separating the
          cheeks and rubbing his hand up and down the division from the upper part to the cleft of my thighs. The whole
          of these proceedings had been intensely repugnant to me, making me feel quite sick; moreover they were totally
          unexpected. When he laid me down on the bed, I thought that he would at once have avouched me. I had not the
          slightest idea that I should first have to go through so much preliminary handling! He now turned me onto my
          side and again took me in his arms, kissing my face, throat and bosom and inhaling the sweet odor emanating
          from my flesh. He evidently was pleased with the charms of his victim. &quot;You are a pretty little
          woman,&quot; he said. &quot;Your figure is very good and you are plump without being fat. Your skin is
          beautifully white and smooth, your flesh is firm. You are fresh as a rose and as fragrant as one. I am fond of
          the delicate perfume of roses on a woman when I have her naked in my arms, and that is I told Dinah to give
          you the bath with the Turkish powder in it.&quot; After toying with me a moment or two longer, he laid me on
          my back, saying: &quot;Now, Dolly, I am going to do the job. To use plain words, I am going to poke you. You
          will feel a little pain, but you must bear it. 85</p>

        <p>Every woman suffers a little the first time she is poked by a man; but afterwards she feels, no pain at
          all-only pleasure.&quot; Now the fatal moment had come! Closing my eyes and covering my face with my hands, I
          waited for the stroke, feeling greatly frightened, very much ashamed and intensely sorrowful. Taking hold of
          my knees, he stretched my legs wide apart. Then, getting between them, he laid himself down upon me with his
          breast on my bosom, at the same time removing my hands from my face and pressing his mouth on my lips. With
          his fingers, he opened the way, and, immediately after, I felt the tip of his member inserted between the lips
          of my &quot;spot.&quot; I shuddered and uttered a low cry. My martyrdom had commenced! Clasping his arms round
          me with his hands under my bottom and holding me tightly, he began to move his loins up and down. I felt the
          column beginning to penetrate me, stretching the parts and causing great pain. Because I was utterly ignorant
          of the size of the erect male organ, and because I was in a state of great fright, the weapon seemed to be of
          enormous dimensions-tit really was not very big)-and I thought that it could not possibly be got into the
          sheath. &quot;Oh! Oh! You are hurting me dreadfully!&quot; I shrieked, beating my hands on the bed and
          shrinking away from him as much as I could, &quot;Oh! Ohh! I can't bear it! Oh-h-h! Take it away! O-h-hl Stop!
          Stop! Oh-h-h!&quot; He worked away steadily, gradually forcing the implement deeper. I felt as if a wedge were
          being driven into me and I was being split like a melon. I winced under his thrusts, quivering all over,
          kicking up my legs and squealing with pain. The weapon, however, was driven deeper and deeper until its
          further progress was checked by something inside the sheath. My ravisher-for such, in reality, he was-had
          reached the membrane which barred the passage: my maidenhead! 86</p>

        <p>Increasing the vigour of his strokes, Randolph battered at the opposing rampart. The pain grew sharper. The
          tears rolled down my cheeks. I writhed and I squealed. But, at the same time, I instinctively arched my loins
          to aid him in his efforts to break through the barrier. He paused for a moment to take breath. Then, gripping
          me tighter, he resumed the assault vigorously. Oh! Now it hurt me! I was small in comparison to him, and the
          parts now seemed to be stretched to bursting. Stiffening myself and clenching my teeth, I lay groaning as the
          horrid thing was being driven with increased force against the obstruction. Randolph quickened his strokes.
          The membrane began to yield. Then suddenly it gave way, and his member went right into me up to the roots. At
          the same instant I felt a sharp, tearing pain which made me utter a shrill cry. Randolph went on working,
          while I, quite involuntarily, moved my bottom up and down, keeping time with his thrusts, though I had not the
          faintest sensation of pleasure-quite the reverse. His movements became quicker and quicker. I writhed with
          pain but still kept heaving up my bottom to meet him. He gave me two or three more furious pushes, then the
          gush of fluid came, and, at the same moment, a curious spasm seized me. I could not help wriggling my bottom
          and squirming from side to side as I felt hot jets spurting unto my very vitals. The thick fluid, 'as it
          flowed over the lacerated edges of the ruptured membrane, seemed slightly to assuage the pain. When all was
          over, I lay in his arms panting, my naked bosom heaving, my face wet with tears and my whole body jerking
          spasmodically. There was a buzzing in my ears, a mist before my eyes and I thought I was going to faint. 87
        </p>

        <p>After a moment or two, Randolph got off me and, giving me a kiss, said: &quot;There, Dolly! It's all over
          now! It won't hurt you so much next time!&quot; When I had recovered a little I became aware that I was wet
          between the legs, and that something was trickling down my thighs. So, sitting up on the bed, I looked at the
          &quot;spot&quot; and saw that blood was oozing from it. I noticed also that the towel under me was stained
          with the proof of my virginity. I was dreadfully frightened, as I had no idea that there would be an effusion
          of blood, and my terrified imagination made me think that I actually had been split open. &quot;Oh! Oh! I am
          bleeding. What shall I do!&quot; I exclaimed, wringing my hands and beginning to cry again. He took me in his
          arms and petted and soothed me, saying: &quot;That's nothing, Dolly. You needn't be alarmed. Every woman
          bleeds a little the first time she is poked.&quot; Then, getting off the bed, he brought a basin of water and
          a sponge. Making me again lie on my back with outstretched legs, he sponged the &quot;spot&quot; and my thighs
          until he had removed all outward traces of his bloody deed. He then told me to put on my nightgown and to get
          between the sheets. I did so, glad to be able at last to cover my nakedness. After he had washed himself,
          Randolph put out all the lamps except a small one. Then he got into bed beside me, but did not touch me. He
          seemed to be tired, and, after giving me a kiss, he turned over onto his side with his back towards me. In a
          short time, I knew by his quiet breathing that he had gone to sleep. I heaved a sigh of relief, heartily glad
          that all was over-for a time, at any rate. My &quot;spot&quot; was sore, and the parts felt stretched. I had a
          curious sensation, as if his stiff member still was sticking in me, and I kept as far away from his as I could
          in the broad bed. At first I could not go to sleep. I was far too miserable, and I lay crying bitterly for the
          loss of my virginity. 88</p>

        <p>&quot;Oh what an unfortunate girl I am. What shall I do! What shall I do!&quot; I kept on saying to myself
          despairingly. After a time, however, my tears ceased to flow, though I continued to sob. Then a dull,
          apathetic feeling came over me. I grew drowsy and at last I sobbed myself to sleep. Strange to say, I slept
          soundly. When I awoke it was broad daylight. Sitting up in bed, I looked at my ravisher, who still was
          sleeping calmly, and I wondered how he could rest so quietly after having ruined a poor, defenceless girl. I
          had a headache and also a heartache, and, on looking at myself in the mirror on the toilet table near the bed,
          I saw that my face was pale and that there were some dark patches under my eyes. I felt very wretched and
          forlorn, but my brain was quite clear, so I was able to review my unhappy position with a certain amount of
          calmness. And it was an unhappy position without doubt! I was a ruined girl. I had no money, and I had lost my
          only friend. (I felt that I could never, under any circumstances, go back to Miss Dean.) What then was to
          become of me? I thought over everything and at last came to the conclusion that I should have to remain at
          Woodlands, for a time at any rate; after all, it was the only thing I could do. So I determined to try to make
          the best of my position as it was at the moment, and to trust to chance for the future. As I have already told
          you, I disliked Randolph. But, since I was going to stay at Woodlands, I made up my mind to conceal my true
          feelings and to let him think that I was quite willing to live with him. It would be to my advantage to do so.
          Presently he woke, and, after yawning and stretching himself, he kissed me, saying with a smile: &quot;Well
          Dolly, how do you feel this morning? A little sore between the legs, I suppose.&quot; I blushed, but acting
          upon my resolution to make the best of things, I forced myself to smile, answering lightly: &quot;Yes, I am
          rather tender, but I suppose the soreness soon will pass off.&quot; 89</p>

        <p>He kissed me again, saying: &quot;I am glad to see you are taking the affair sensibly, not whining or
          complaining. The thing's done and can't be undone. I'll make you very comfortable at Woodlands, and it will be
          your own fault if you are not happy. I am an easy man to get on with when I have my own way,&quot; he added
          with a laugh. He then played with my breasts and felt my bottom till he was ready to proceed to more
          sophisticated endeavours. Then, placing me in position, he rolled my nightdress up to my chin and got into me
          for the second time. Since there now was no obstacle in the way, a very few movements of his loins were
          sufficient to drive the weapon up to the hilt in the sheath. He poked me with full force. I suffered a good
          deal while the great thing was being worked up and down in the sore, raw folds of my &quot;spot.&quot; The
          pain made me grind my teeth and utter little cries. Again I was forced by nature to heave my bottom up and
          down to his strokes and, when the spasm seized me, I wriggled and squirmed till I had received every drop of
          his offering. I did not by any means like my second poke, but it had not been so intensely repugnant to me as
          the first. Randolph sat up and now looked at me as I lay on my back, breathing hard with flushed cheeks and
          moist eyes. &quot;It did not hurt you so very much that time, did it Dolly?&quot; he observed. &quot;No-o, not
          so very much,&quot; I replied in a shaky voice. I was feeling rather inclined to cry, for the &quot;spot&quot;
          was smarting dreadfully. &quot;Oh, you'll soon get used to it, and then you'll like it,&quot; he remarked,
          laughing at my woebegone face. I thought to myself that I might get used to it, but I did not think I should
          ever get to like it. Just then there was a knock at the door and Susan, one of the chambermaids, came in with
          tea and toast. She came to the bedside 90</p>

        <p>and placed the tray on a little table, her eyes resting for a moment on us as we lay side by side. The girl's
          face was perfectly expressionless, but I felt ashamed that she should see me in bed with her master. My cheeks
          grew hot, and I did not know which way to look. She got my bath ready and tidied the room, picking up my
          clothes, which were all scattered about the floor where Randolph had thrown them when he stripped me
          overnight. Then she left the room and we drank our tea, which was most refreshing to me, for I was faint and
          thirsty. Randolph then got up and, taking his garments, went to his own apartments, leaving me alone to dress.
          While having my bath I examined the &quot;spot,&quot; finding the inner lips red and swollen. Then I bathed
          them well with cold water. After completing my toilet, I went downstairs, and, going out to the garden, betook
          myself to a secluded spot, where I sat down on a long, cane chair under a magnolia tree. It was a beautiful
          morning. The sun, though not high, was shining brightly in a cloudless sky of pale blue. The birds were
          twittering. A soft breeze was blowing. Drops of dew still were sparkling on the gossamer grass and were
          festooning the bushes, and the air was filled with the sweet scent of flowers. I felt very languid, so,
          putting my feet up on the chair, I leaned back, inhaling the fresh morning air and feeling a great sensation
          of relief at being alone. After the trying time which I had gone through, the calm and quiet of everything had
          a soothing effect upon me and my heart seemed to grow a little less heavy. In about half an hour's time I
          returned to the house and went into the breakfast room. Randolph soon made his appearance and we sat down to
          the morning meal. My appetite was not as good as usual. I felt ill at ease in the presence of the man who had
          taken my maidenhead, and, whenever I caught his 91</p>

        <p>eye, I could not help blushing. He, however, was quite at his ease, chatting away gaily throughout the meal;
          when it was over, he ordered his horse to be brought and then he went off to the plantation to make a round of
          inspection after his absence. Shortly after he had gone, Dinah came into the room and, handing me a basket of
          keys, asked me respectfully to give her my orders for the day. I noticed that she no longer called me Missy
          but addressed me as &quot;Missus.&quot; Since I did not want to be bothered with the housekeeping of such a
          large establishment, I told Dinah to keep the keys and to carry on the management as before. She appeared glad
          to hear that she was not going to be deprived of her authority, and, taking the basket of keys, went away
          smiling. Randolph did not come back to lunch, so I ate by myself in the big dining room, waited on by Lucy and
          Kate. When I had finished, I went to the library, where I spent the afternoon reading. I did not feel inclined
          to take walking exercise that day. Randolph came home late, so I did not see him till we met at dinner at
          seven o'clock. My appetite was returning, so I managed to partake of some of the tasty dishes. I also drank a
          glass of champagne, which I liked, as it exhilarated me slightly without affecting my head. The evening
          passed, and we went upstairs to my room at eleven o'clock. Randolph allowed me to undress myself, and, while I
          was doing so, he sat on a chair watching me. We soon were in bed, and, a few moments afterwards, I found
          myself groaning and wincing as the dart was being forced for the third time into my still-tender flesh. Before
          I got up in the morning, I had twice again wiggled my bottom and squirmed in Randolph's arms. 92</p>

        <p>CHAPTER 9 I learn some cunning tricks of the &quot;ars amandi&quot;; loving, without loving; Randolph's
          amorousness; I become a &quot;past mistress&quot; in the joyful craft of bottom-wriggling, but find withal no
          mental joy therein. Some time passed. I had settled down to my life at Woodlands, adapting myself to my
          surroundings and endeavouring not to think of the future. A dressmaker from Richmond paid several visits to
          the house, and I was well supplied with pretty frocks of all sorts for morning and evening wear, as well as a
          quantity of fine, richly-laced undergarments, silk stockings of all colours and numerous pairs of shoes. I had
          also a riding costume with breeches and boots; a horse was always at my disposal, and I was learning to ride.
          Randolph had also given me a lot of jewellery; he always made me dress for dinner in a low-necked frock, and
          one of the octoroons, a girl named Rosa, had been specially appointed to act as my maid. Randolph was a clever
          man and well read, but he was a thorough libertine who considered women merely toys for the gratification of
          his sensual desires. Before my arrival at Woodlands all the pretty quadroon and octoroon slave girls had been
          his concubines. Not that he had been in the habit of sleeping with any one of them, but, whenever he wanted a
          girl, he would give her orders to be in his room at a certain hour of the day or night, as the case might be;
          then, after he had amused himself with her for an hour or two, he would send her away. But though he used the
          girls as playthings whenever he felt inclined, he had not the slightest soft feeling towards them. They were
          his slaves, nothing more; and, whenever a girl misbehaved or offended him in any way, he either would send her
          to one of the overseers to be whipped or would inflict the punishment with his own hands. He did not love me
          in the least. But he admired me, often telling me that I was a pretty girl and that I had a good figure. He
          was fond of 93</p>

        <p>seeing me naked and of posing me in various positions before the large mirror in my room so he might be able
          to see both the back and front of my body at the same time. He soon acquainted me with the meaning of all the
          naughty words in the vocabulary of &quot;love&quot;-words which I never had heard before-and in course of time
          he taught me practically all the different positions in which it is possible for a man carnally to possess and
          enjoy a woman, either by day or by night, either in bed or out. Invariably I was submissive to his whims. He
          was a masterful man, and his strong will dominated my weak one. Moreover, I was always rather afraid of him.
          In my innocence I had thought that there was only one way of administering the stroke, and, at first, I was
          greatly astonished at the number and variety of the positions in which he rogered me. He would
          &quot;have&quot; me lying on my back, or on my side; also standing, kneeling, sitting or on all fours. He
          would &quot;do it&quot; to me from behind, while I leaned over the side of the bed or the back of a chair or
          the edge of a table, and he sometimes would lie on his back and make me straddle him with my knees, my back
          being turned towards his face, so that he could see my bottom. In this latter case, I had personally to fix
          the weapon in the sheath, and do all &quot;the work&quot; by raising myself up and down on my knees. Sometimes
          Randolph rode me when I was stark naked, sometimes when I was half dressed and sometimes in my chemise,
          stockings and shoes, or perhaps with nothing on but my drawers. Frequently after dinner he would
          &quot;have&quot; me in full evening dress, with tightly laced stays. On these occasions he would sit on a
          chair while I would stand in front of him with my back turned. Then, putting his hands up my clothes, he would
          feel me till he was properly excited. Finally, unbuttoning his trousers, he would let out his member in full
          erection, with the red tip uncovered and ready for action. I had then to pull open the slit of my drawers and
          to hold my petticoats above my waist, then lower myself upon the dart until it was into me as far as it could
          go and my bottom rested on his thighs. In that position he would possess me. 94</p>

        <p>He used to say that a woman should never be &quot;had&quot; twice in succession in the same way, and he told
          me that if a man always poked a woman in the same position, he would get tired of her sooner than if he varied
          the embraces. After my shame had worn off and I had got used to being stroked in this way, I discovered that
          there was a strain of voluptuousness in my disposition, and, though I never liked Randolph, I was not adverse
          to his embraces. I always let him do what he liked, by day or night, without murmuring; and he often told me
          that I was a &quot;very good mount.&quot; (Randolph was a man who always called a &quot;spade a spade.&quot;)
          I don't think that after my arrival in the house he had much to do with the slave girls; anyhow, he always
          slept with me, and it was rarely that a night passed without his poking me once at least. I should have been
          better pleased had he let me more alone at night, for I was a sound sleeper and I hated being awakened to be
          pulled about in all sorts of ways and then poked in some uncomfortable position. I gradually had grown
          accustomed to him, and called him by his first name, George, and, though he often we very ill-tempered and
          sometimes spoke extremely harshly to me, he never laid his hand upon me in anger during the whole time I lived
          with him. Randolph was one of the richest planters in Virginia and his family was one of the oldest, but I
          soon found out that he was not, so to speak, in &quot;society.&quot; His character as a libertine was
          well-known throughout the State: consequently no ladies ever came to the house. But he often gave dinner
          parties, at which I took my place at the table opposite him. On these occasions, all the young women in the
          house, chambermaids as well as parlour maids, were very smartly dressed in well-fitting black frocks with
          white caps and aprons, and it often happened that three, four or even more of the gentlemen who had come from
          a distance would remain in the house all night. 95</p>

        <p>These parties always wound up with high card play, during which a good deal of liquor was drunk, and the
          house became a regular &quot;Liberty Hall.&quot; Randolph allowed his guests to do whatever they liked. If a
          guest took a fancy to any particular girl, all he had to do was to inform Randolph, who at once would send for
          the damsel. The gentleman then would take her to a bedroom and poke her, returning afterwards to the card
          room. And every guest who stayed in the house for the night could take a woman to bed with him if he felt
          inclined to do so. However, I was always treated with respect by the men-to my face, at any rate-for Randolph,
          having chosen to put me at the head of his table, always insisted on his friends' treating me as if I really
          had been the lady of the house. Since he was known to be a dead shot with a pistol, and always ready to use
          it, not one of the gentlemen who visited Woodlands ever attempted to take a liberty with me. Nor did one ever
          speak to me in an improper manner. 96</p>

        <p>CHAPTER 10 The slaves get to know me; voluptuous effects of flagellation; my maid, Rosa, is whipped for
          impertinence; description of her bottom and legs; Randolph's opinions on the right to rape coloured women;
          Randolph puts me on the sofa and does the &quot;usual thing.&quot; The weeks slipped away. My health remained
          good, my spirits revived and I was not unhappy. I had plenty of books to read, I rode nearly every day-
          sometimes alone, sometimes with Randolph-and I often took a long buggy ride. We occasionally spent a few days
          in Richmond, staying at the best hotel and going every night to the theatre or to some other place of
          amusement. Before that time, I never had been in a theatre, so I enjoyed the performances immensely and wished
          very much that I could go on the stage. I told Randolph one day, but he only laughed, telling me that I was
          &quot;a little goose&quot; and that I had not enough &quot;go&quot; in me to make an actress. At Woodlands I
          often amused myself by roaming about the plantation, which was very extensive. There were upwards of
          twohundred field hands, male and female, all of whom were engaged in cultivating the cotton. Randolph fed his
          slaves well and did not overwork them, but otherwise he was a hard master. His four overseers had orders never
          to pass over a fault or to allow the least shirking of work; consequently, the strap, switch and paddle
          constantly were being used on both men and women. The slaves' quarters were divided into three blocks of
          &quot;cabins,&quot; as they were called; one block was for the married couples, another for the single men and
          the third for the unmarried women and girls. But as soon as work was over for the day, all the slaves of both
          sexes met together round a fire, where they spent most of the night dancing, singing and playing the banjo. As
          a matter of course there was a great deal of poking. However, no notice was taken of what slaves did among
          themselves at night, so long 97</p>

        <p>as they were present the next morning when roll was called by the overseers. The slaves soon got to know me
          well, and, since I took an interest in them and often was able to do them little kindnesses, they all became
          fond of me. I liked these poor, good-natured creatures who were always light-hearted except when they happened
          to be smarting from a whipping. Although I often had seen the marks of the lash on the bodies of the runaways
          who had passed through our station, I hitherto had never seen a slave whipped Dinah, in her capacity of
          housekeeper, maintained strict discipline, so she often brought one of the women or one of the girls before
          Randolph for neglecting her work or some other offence, and sometimes he himself gave the offender a whipping
          on her bottom with the switch. I occasionally had heard the squeaks of a culprit, but I always had avoided
          being present at the punishment. Whipping a girl seemed to have an exciting effect on Randolph, for, after
          switching one, he invariably used to come to me, wherever I happened to be, and poke me with great vigour. I
          thought it strange at the time, but I since have found out that men's passions are inflamed by whipping the
          bottom of a female until she cries and writhes with pain, and, if they can't do it themselves, they like
          seeing it done. This is a curious, but undoubted fact, and it shows what cruel creatures men are. I have
          already mentioned that an octoroon girl named Rosa had been appointed to act as my maid. This girl formerly
          had been Randolph's favourite, but, since my arrival at Woodlands, he had had nothing to do with her. When
          Rosa found that she was entirely neglected and that she was obliged to serve as my maid, she had been filled
          with bitter resentment. In fact, the girl was bitterly jealous. She had shown her vexation from the first, by
          constant sullenness, and at times she was very impertinent to me. But I had borne with her ill temper and had
          always been kind to her, trying to make her like me, 98</p>

        <p>for I pitied her and all the other slave girls. However, nothing which I could do had any effect in softening
          the girl; she continued to be sulky and disrespectful, though I had managed to make all the other women and
          girls fond of me. I knew that if I reported Rosa to Randolph he would have punished her, but, since I did not
          wish to get her into trouble, I did not say a word. Rosa was twenty years of age, tall, handsome and not
          darker than an ordinary brunette, her complexion being a clear olive with a tinge of pink showing on her
          cheeks. She had a well-rounded figure, with full bust and broad hips. Her feet were small and her hands were
          smooth, for she never had done any hard work. She had a profusion of long, wavy, dark brown hair. Her eyes
          also were brown, large, and soft. She had white, regular teeth and full, red, moist lips. Her voice was low
          and musical, but she was perfectly uneducated, not being able either to read or to write, and she spoke in the
          usual &quot;nigger&quot; way. One morning when she was helping me dress, she appeared to be in worse temper
          than usual, and, while brushing my hair, pulled it so roughly that I several times had to tell her to be more
          careful. I spoke gently, but my remonstrances seemed only to irritate her. Tossing her head and giving my hair
          a nasty pull, she said in a most saucy way: &quot;I oughtened to be brushin yo' hair at all. Becos you is
          white, you tinks you is a very fine lady but you is not a bit better dan me. You isn't married to de Massa,
          yet you sleeps wid him every night.&quot; I flushed with anger. Rising from my seat, I ordered the girl to
          leave the room. She did so, laughing. The tears came into my eyes. My heart swelled and I felt a deep sense of
          degradation. It was humiliating that, owing to a series of misfortunes, I should have come to be spoken to in
          such a coarse way by a slave girl. But, alas! What she had said was the truth. I really was no better than
          she. 99</p>

        <p>After a moment or two, I put up my hair, finished dressing and went down to breakfast. I had not intended to
          say anything to Randolph, but he noticed that I was depressed and asked me what was the matter. &quot;Oh,
          nothing much,&quot; I replied. &quot;Rosa has been a little impertinent to me.&quot; Not being satisfied with
          my answer, he insisted on knowing what the girl had said to me. Unable to contain my hurt any longer, I told
          him exactly what had occurred, adding that Rosa had always been more or less impertinent to me, and I
          suggested that, if he spoke to her, she probably would be more respectful to me in the future. &quot;I will
          speak to her presently,&quot; he said. Then he went on quietly with his breakfast. I thought no more of the
          affair, and, when the meal was over, we left the room and went into an adjoining apartment, where I amused
          myself reading the newspaper while Randolph smoked his cigar. When he had finished, he rang the bell, which
          was answered by one of the parlour maids, Jane. &quot;Go tell Dinah and Rosa that I want them here, then come
          back yourself,&quot; he said to the girl. She went away, returning in about five minutes accompanied by the
          other two women. Randolph rose from his seat with a stern expression on his face and, turning to Rosa, who was
          looking rather frightened, said angrily: &quot;You young hussy! I have been hearing about your conduct. How
          dare you speak to your mistress like that? Did you think I would let you insult a white lady? You are getting
          too saucy, but I will take the sauce out of you. I am going to whip you.&quot; 100</p>

        <p>Rosa turned as pale as her olive complexion would allow. A frightened expression came into her eyes and she
          burst into tears. &quot;Oh! Massa!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;Don't whip me! Oh! Please don't whip me! I'se
          very sorry I was sassy to de Missis. Oh! Do let me off an' I will be a good gal and never be sassy
          again.&quot; Then turning to me she said imploringly: &quot;Oh! Missus. Forgive me, an' ask de Massa not to
          whip me dis time.&quot; I did not want the girl to be whipped, so I asked Randolph to let her go away, saying
          that I was sure that she was sorry for what she had said and that I did not think she would offend again. But
          her master was very angry with her and would not consent to let her off. Turning to Dinah, he said curtly:
          &quot;Take her up.&quot; I had no idea what was meant by the words, but Dinah knew what to do. She often had
          &quot;taken up&quot; naughty slave girls on her broad, strong back. Going up to Rosa, she seized her by the
          wrists, and, turning round, drew the girl's arms over her shoulders Then, bending well forward, she raised the
          culprit's feet off the floor so that her body was brought into a curved position. Not wishing to see the
          punishment inflicted, I walked towards the door. But Randolph peremptorily ordered me to remain in the room.
          &quot;Turn up her clothes, Jane, and, mind you, hold them well out of the way,&quot; he said. Jane went to the
          right side of the delinquent, and, rolling up her skirt, petticoats and chemise, held them high above her
          waist. The girl's under linen was perfectly clean, but she wore no drawers-none of the slave women possessed
          drawers. She had a fine, big, well-shaped bottom and, owing to the curved position in which she was being
          held, the large, plump round cheeks swelled out in high relief at a most convenient angle for receiving the
          switch. Her olive-tinted skin was perfectly smooth, her thighs were large and well-rounded, her legs were
          shapely and her ankles were trim. She was wearing white 101</p>

        <p>stockings, gartered with bows of blue ribbon, and she had on neat shoes. Randolph went to a cabinet from
          which he took a hickory switch-he kept a switch in nearly every room -then, placing himself at the left side
          of the culprit, said: &quot;Now, I'll teach you to respect your mistress. I have not whipped you for some
          time, but I'm going to make your bottom smart now.&quot; Rosa had not struggled or uttered a word while she
          was being &quot;taken up&quot; and prepared for the switch. But now she turned her head, looking at Randolph
          with a dog-like expression of appeal in her great, brown eyes, and said beseechingly, while the tears ran down
          her cheeks: &quot;Oh, Massa, don't whip poor Rosa hard.&quot; He began to whip her, laying on the strokes
          smartly and as calmly as if he were merely beating a dog. The girl winced, drawing the cheeks of her bottom
          with a jerk each time the switch fell. Long, red weals rose on her skin. Her plump flesh quivered and she
          kicked up her feet, squealing shrilly and exclaiming in gasps: &quot;Oh, Massa! - Oh, Massa! - Don't whip - me
          - so - hard-! Oh! Massa! Oh!-Good Massa, please-don't whip - me - so - hard! Oh! Oh! Stop Massa! Oh!
          Please-please-stop. My bottom-is-so-sore-I Oh! Oh!&quot; The switch continued to stripe her writhing bottom,
          extracting loud cries from her, making her struggle and plunge violently. But Dinah, slightly separating her
          legs and bending well forward, easily held the shrieking girl in position while Randolph whipped away
          steadily. Jane held up the girl's petticoats and Dinah gripped her wrists tightly while Rosa, squealing and
          twisting herself about, drew up her legs one after the other, then kicked them out in all directions, and, in
          her contortions opened her thighs so that I could see the curly dark brown hair shading the
          &quot;spot&quot;-and every now and then I caught a glimpse of the bright pink orifice. 102</p>

        <p>Rosa's skin was rather fine, and she appeared to feel the pain acutely, begging piteously for mercy. But
          Randolph, utterly regardless of her cries and entreaties, went on whipping till the surface of her bottom,
          from the loins to the thighs, was covered with red weals. Then, throwing down the switch, he said: &quot;Let
          her go.&quot; Jane let the sufferer's petticoats fall and Dinah released her wrists. Then Rosa stood on her
          feet, twisting her lips and wailing with pain while she wiped the fast-flowing tears from her eyes with her
          apron. &quot;There, Rosa,&quot; said Randolph, &quot;I have let you off rather easily this time, but if I ever
          again hear that you have been saucy to your mistress, I will whip you till the blood runs down your thighs.
          Now you can all go back to your work.&quot; Rosa, still wailing, slunk out of the room with her hand pressed
          to her smarting bottom; the other two women followed, and Randolph and I were left alone. He put away the
          switch, then, turning to me, said: I don't think she'll give you any more trouble, but if she does let me
          know.&quot; &quot;Oh, George!&quot; I said. &quot;How could you bring yourself to whip the girl so severely.
          She is a pretty creature and I know you often have had her.&quot; He laughed. &quot;Yes. I have often
          &quot;had&quot; her and will &quot;have&quot; her again if ever I feel inclined to. But I will also whip her
          again whenever she requires punishment. She is only a nigger, though she is so light in colour. You are a
          Northern girl, so you don't understand how we Southerners look upon our slave women. When they take our fancy
          we amuse ourselves with them, but we feel no compunction in whipping them whenever they misbehave. Their
          bodies belong to us, so we can use them in any way we please. Personally, I have no more regard for my slaves
          than for my dogs and horses.&quot; Though I had got to know Randolph pretty well by that time, I felt rather
          shocked by his unfeeling sentiments. However, I made no 103</p>

        <p>remark. He was standing in front of me, and I noticed that there was a protuberance in a certain part of his
          trousers. I guessed what was coming. He went on: &quot;You know, Dolly, whipping a girl always excites me, so
          I am going to have you.&quot; Then, laying me on the couch, he pulled up my petticoats, took down my drawers
          and entered me with more than usual vigour. Whipping Rosa's bottom certainly had acted on him as a powerful
          aphrodisiac! When all was over and I had fastened my drawers, we went to our respective rooms and made
          ourselves tidy. Then he ordered the buggy and we went for a long drive in the country, lunching at a farm
          house and not returning home until it was time to dress for dinner. When I got to my room I found Rosa there,
          as usual, waiting to assist me in making my toilet. She was looking very subdued and her manner was humble and
          submissive. She had received a severe whipping, and her bottom must have been very sore. I felt for her,
          knowing as I did how dreadfully the switch could sting. &quot;I am sorry for you Rosa,&quot; I said. &quot;Did
          the whipping hurt you very much?&quot; &quot;Oh! Yes Missis,&quot; she answered, giving a little shudder at
          the remembrance, &quot;it did hurt me most drefful. De Massa never give me such a hard whippin before. Dinah
          has rubbed my bottom with possum fat, an' dat has taken de sting out of de weals som, but I'se very sore an' I
          can't sit down easy.&quot; She helped me to dress, seeming very anxious to please me in every way, and always
          speaking most respectfully. From that day she was a changed girl so far as regarded her behaviour to me. I
          never had occasion to find fault with her again during the rest of my stay at Woodlands. 104</p>

        <p>CHAPTER 11 A Rabelaisian banquet of nude demoiselles; a shocking orgy; ten naked waitresses and their
          bashfulness; hot viands and bottomspanking escapades, and the inevitable sequel! Three months passed, during
          which period I went through some varied experiences and saw some curious sights. If I were to relate
          everything that occurred, my story would be too long. However, I will describe one or two of the incidents
          just to give you an idea of what sort of man Randolph was. I have already mentioned the dinner parties he
          frequently gave for his male friends, and I have told you that these gatherings were always of a very free and
          easy sort. At one of these dinners the proceedings were of a more licentious character than usual. Randolph
          had invited ten guests, which was the usual number. He was very particular on these occasions that all the
          girls should be nicely dressed, so Dinah used to parade them for my inspection just before the guests arrived.
          I merely had to see that the girls should be nicely attired outwardly, but Dinah, before bringing them to me,
          had to see that each girl was clean in person and that she had on clean under linen. On the day of which I am
          speaking, after my own toilet had been made, I went down to the hall and inspected the girls, finding them all
          looking clean and smart. Then I went into the drawing room where Randolph was lounging on a chair, turning
          over the leaves of a large, illustrated book of Rabelais, an author whose works he was very fond of reading. I
          told him that I had seen the girls and that they all were looking very nice in their black frocks. To my
          astonishment, he burst out laughing and said: &quot;Oh, they won't wear frocks this evening. I have got such a
          splendid idea from a picture in this old book. It's a wonder it never struck me before.&quot; 105</p>

        <p>&quot;What is it?&quot; I asked. &quot;I have just been reading the chapter which tells how Pantagruel and
          his companions were entertained at a banquet by the Papimaniacs and were waited on by a bevy of nude damsels.
          The dinner tonight shall be a reproduction of the scene described. There are ten men coming and each man shall
          be waited on by a naked girl. It will be great fun and also quite a novel entertainment for my guests.&quot;
          Although I was accustomed to his vagaries, this new freak horrified me. I should have to sit at the table with
          ten men, while the same number of women displayed their naked bodies! The idea was most repugnant to me, and I
          blushed, a thing I had not done for many a day. &quot;Oh George!&quot; I exclaimed. &quot;Don't do such a
          thing! It is too shameful.&quot; &quot;Yes I will,&quot; he said, laughing heartily, &quot;Why Dolly, you are
          actually blushing! I thought you had got over all your squeamishness by this time.&quot; &quot;Oh, but this is
          a particularly horrid idea,&quot; I observed. &quot;If you are determined to carry it out, don't make me come
          to the table. Just fancy what a dreadful position it would be for me to have to sit among a lot of men,
          surrounded by naked women. I should not know which way to look.&quot; He again laughed, but there was in his
          eyes a hard look which I had got to know and which meant that he had determined to have his way. &quot;It does
          not matter which way you look,&quot; he said, &quot;You are looking very pretty and that's sufficient. You
          will have to take your place at table as usual, and you must appear to be quite unconscious that the women are
          naked. None of my guests will insult you by word or look.&quot; I still remonstrated, but he sternly told me
          to shut up or it would be the worse for me. I shut up, for I was afraid of him, knowing him to be a man 106
        </p>

        <p>who would stop at nothing and that if I made any more objections he might take it into his head to whip me.
          Now sending for Dinah, he told her what he intended, to do, and gave her orders to have ten of the young women
          stripped naked in readiness. He named the ones he wanted, selecting those who had the best figures. Seven were
          quadroons, the other three octoroons-one of them being Rosa. Dinah, with a perfectly unmoved countenance,
          received the order and some further instructions. &quot;All right, Sab,&quot; she said, &quot;de gals shall be
          ready.&quot; Then she left the room. It was nearly seven o'clock, and the guests began to arrive. Some came on
          horseback, some came in buggies. In a short time the whole party had assembled. All the gentlemen were more or
          less known to me, and everyone, upon entering the room, shook hands with me in a polite manner. The men were
          of all ages, the youngest being about twentyfive and the oldest upwards of fifty. Most of them were bachelors,
          but I knew that some were married men. Presently, Dinah, looking very smart in her black frock and white cap,
          made her appearance with a tray of cocktails, and, while the guests were imbibing, Randolph said with a smile
          on his face: &quot;I suppose, gentlemen, that most of you have read Rabelais. Those who have perused the book
          will remember the description of the banquet given to Pantagruel in the island of Papimania.&quot;
          &quot;Aye!&quot; cried the company. &quot;And what a banquet it was!&quot; &quot;Well,&quot; said Randolph,
          grinning lasciviously, &quot;I intend our dinner tonight to be, as nearly as possible, a counterpart of that
          banquet. I think that I can give you as good a fare and as good wine as Homenas gave Pantagruel and his
          companions. I also think that the 'she-butlers' will please you. They may not be so fair-skinned as were the
          damsels of Papimania, but in all other respects you will find that the 'waitresses' 107</p>

        <p>will answer the description of the ones mentioned in the book. They are 'tight lasses,' good conditioned,
          comely, waggish and fit for business.&quot; The men who had read Rabelais and knew what was coming laughed and
          clapped their hands. The men who had not read the book looked puzzled. However, knowing Randolph's little
          ways, these latter libertines knew all too well that something funny was going to happen. In a short time
          dinner was announced, whereupon the oldest of the guests, a gentleman named Harrington-whom I knew to have
          grown up daughters-offered me his arm and led me into the brilliantlylighted dining room. The other men
          followed and we took our places at the table, which was beautifully decorated with flowers and glittering with
          plate and glass. Randolph took his place at one end of the table, I faced him at the other end and five of the
          guests sat on each side. When everyone was comfortably settled, Randolph touched a small handbell beside him.
          Then the door at the far end of the room was opened and Dinah came in, followed by ten naked young women with
          their long black hair flowing loose on their shoulders. Each girl, without hesitation, took her position
          behind one of the guests-Dinah had told them where to go. They all showed signs of bashfulness, for, though
          every one of them had on various occasions passed through the hands of gentlemen singly in a bedroom, none
          ever had been exposed stark-naked before the eyes of a number of people. Some cast their eyes downward and
          fidgeted as they stood. All of them placed their hands over the &quot;spot&quot; between their legs. I felt
          horribly uncomfortable. Hot thrills passed over me and my cheeks grew scarlet. The men smiled, casting amused
          glances at one another. Then they looked with gleaming eyes at the naked girls. Some were slim, some were
          plump. Some were tall, some were of medium size and some were short. But all were pretty and had shapely
          figures, with firm, round breasts and good bottoms. The brilliant light, shining on their naked bodies, made
          their smooth, olive-tinted skins glisten. The hair covering the &quot;spots&quot; was, in all cases, black or
          dark brown, and one 108</p>

        <p>of the quadroons, a plump little girl nineteen years of age named Fanny, who had been whipped a couple of
          days before, still bore the pink stripes left by the switch. Rosa was the prettiest of all the girls. She also
          had the best figure, and she was the lightest in colour. Consequently she attracted the most admiration. The
          dinner soon was in full progress. The girls, directed by Dinah, bustled about bringing in the dishes, changing
          the plates and filling the glasses with champagne. Some of them, not being accustomed to waiting at table,
          were rather awkward. But, whenever a girl made a mistake, she received from Randolph the next time she came
          within reach of his arm a slap on the bottom which made her jump and squeal and clap her hand to the smarting
          target. The gentlemen talked and laughed as unconcernedly as if they were quite accustomed to being waited on
          by naked women and to seeing them smacked whenever they made a mistake. But it was a most trying time for me.
          I sat with my eyes fixed on my plate, and with a very red face, making a pretence of eating and hardly
          listening to the conversation of Mr. Harrington, the old gentleman who had taken me into dinner and who was
          sitting on my right. He chattered away to me, but I noticed that he kept leering lecherously at Rosa's full
          bosom and broad bottom as she tripped gracefully here and there. She evidently had taken his fancy more than
          any of the other girls, and I felt sure that later on my pretty maid would be poked by the old satyr. The
          dinner was a long one, but at last it was over and the gentlemen settled down to smoke their cigars and sip
          their coffee while the conversation turned upon slaves and the price of cotton. No improper remarks of any
          sort were made by the men, but their eyes frequently were turned with lustful looks on the naked girls
          standing in various attitudes about the room. 109</p>

        <p>When the cigars had been smoked, we all went into the drawing room, the girls being told to follow. I tried
          to slip away, but Randolph ordered me to remain. He then told his guests to sit on a row of chairs at the end
          of the room. When they had done so, he posed the naked girls in groups in various positions with their arms
          round each other, some standing, some kneeling and some lying on their sides at full length so that their
          figures could be seen both back and front. These poses plastiques greatly pleased the spectators, and they
          gloated over each lascivious tableau, applauding vigorously, while the girls, utterly astonished at what they
          were being made to do, gazed about timidly with their big, ox-like eyes. At last Randolph exhausted his
          ingenuity in inventing fresh tableaux, and I thought he would at least let the girls put on their clothes. But
          he did not. He had not yet finished with their naked bodies. &quot;Now gentlemen,&quot; he said, &quot;if you
          will go into the corridor I will let you see some young mares race. Some of them are rather fat, but I dare
          say that I shall be able to make them show their best paces.&quot; The men, laughing boisterously, trooped out
          of the room and stationed themselves at intervals on each side of the long, broad corridor. The races were to
          be run in heats, the course being from one end of the corridor to the other and back, twice over. Before
          starting the girls, Randolph got a long, heavy whip, and cracking it in the air, warned them that they had
          better run as fast as they could. Then, as soon as the first lot were off he took up his position halfway down
          one side of the corridor and, as the runners dashed past him in the several heats, he flicked the bottom of
          any girl who appeared not to be exerting herself, the touch of the whip extracting a shrill cry from the
          victim and making her increase her speed, while a red mark instantly showed on her skin where the end of the
          lash had fallen. 110</p>

        <p>The men grew excited. They laughed, cheered and betted on the girls as they raced up and down the corridor,
          their long hair flowing loosely behind them, their marvellous breasts undulating, their bottoms swaying. After
          the runners had a rest, there was what Randolph called a &quot;jockey race.&quot; The five strongest girls had
          to take on their backs the other five girls, who held on by putting their arms round the necks and their legs
          round the loins of their respective &quot;mounts.&quot; This time the course was once up and down the
          corridor, and heavy bets were laid by the men on the women they fancied. The signal to start was given, and
          the race began. The gentlemen whooped and shouted as they watched the extraordinary sight: five naked women
          staggering along the corridor as fast as they could, each woman carrying on her back another naked female! The
          muscles of the thighs and bottoms of the carriers quivered under the strain, while the legs of the riders were
          so stretched apart by the position in which they clung to their steeds that the spectators could see the hair
          in the cleft of the thighs. And nearly every one of the bottoms was marked either with the prints of
          Randolph's fingers, or with the red dot made by the flick of the whip. Two of the girls had both finger marks
          and whip marks, and, when all was over, only three out of the ten had spotless bottoms. The men's eyes
          gleamed. Their faces were flushed, and I could see that they were all in a state of great sensual excitement.
          After a close struggle, the race was won by a sturdy young quadroon woman twenty-five years of age, named
          Eliza, who had carried the youngest of all the girls, a slightly-built, shapely octoroon named Helen, who was
          only eighteen years old. Then we went back to the drawing room, where the girls were allowed to sit while
          Randolph told Dinah to give each of them a glass of wine and water. 111</p>

        <p>The poor girls all were very thirsty. Some of them had tears in their eyes, and one or two were rubbing their
          bottoms. The girls who had been carriers were panting for breath; their bosoms were heaving tumultuously and
          their naked bodies were moist with perspiration. As soon as they had recovered their breath, the ten were made
          to stand in a row with their hands by their sides. Then Randolph said: &quot;Now gentlemen, you will each
          choose a girl, either for a short time, or for the whole night. You can please yourselves.&quot; The men,
          laughing and joking, began to make their selections. In cases where two or three wanted the same girl, the
          matter was settled by tossing a coin. Rosa was the favourite. Five of the men, including Mr. Harrington,
          wanted her. Finally the old gentleman, as the senior member of the party, was allowed to take her. The
          selections being made, each man, followed submissively by the naked girl whom he had chosen, left the
          apartment and went upstairs to a bedroom. Randolph and I were left alone. He was very much pleased with his
          evening's entertainment. &quot;Oh, Dolly,&quot; he said, laughing, &quot;what fun it has been. I've never had
          such a game before. I'll do it again some day or other, and, when I do, every woman in the house shall strip
          for the races.&quot; I did not feel at all mirthfully inclined. I had been wretched and uncomfortable
          throughout the whole proceedings. Moreover the sight of so many bare bottoms, naked bosoms and uncovered
          &quot;spots&quot; had given me a feeling of disgust-a woman is not excited by seeing the nakedness of other
          women; at any rate I never am. &quot;I think it all very horrid and shameful,&quot; I observed. &quot;I don't
          care what you think,&quot; he replied. &quot;It pleased me and amused my guests, and that's all I care about.
          But it has been very exciting work. I am feeling very randy and my tool is aching from prolonged erection, so
          I must take the stiffness out of it at once, I will have you sitting down, so as not to crumple your pretty
          frock. 112</p>

        <p>So saying, he seated himself on a chair and let loose his member, which stood straight up with its red tip
          uncovered. &quot;Come along, now, Dolly, you know what to do,&quot; he said impatiently. I did know what to
          do. Turning my back to him, I raised my petticoats above my waist and pulled open the slit of my drawers as
          widely as possible, exposing the whole of my bottom. Then, straddling his thighs, with a leg on each side of
          him, I lowered myself upon his upstanding member, which he guided into its place. The weight of my body forced
          the weapon up to the hilt in its tender sheath. Randolph now clasped me round the waist under my clothes,
          while I, raising myself up and down on my toes, pumped away until the spasm seized me and I felt his hot
          torrents inundating my insides. Then I lay back panting against his breast. Presently I got off his lap,
          pulled my drawers into place and shook my petticoats straight, fearful that some of the men might be coming
          back at any moment and not wanting to be seen by any of them while I was in so dishevelled a state. As it was,
          I got done just in time. Randolph and I had hardly sat down again before one of the gentlemen made his
          appearance. He was followed at intervals by others until at last all had reassembled except three, who had
          elected to stay all night with their girls. The other girls, after being poked, had been allowed to return to
          their quarters. Dinah then brought in a tray of liquors and the men refreshed themselves. Next, everyone sat
          down to play cards. I slipped out of the room and went to bed, glad to get away from the men, though not one
          of them had said an improper word to me during the evening. It was very late-or, to speak more correctly, it
          was early in the morning-when Randolph came to bed. I was fast asleep, but he woke 113</p>

        <p>me by pinching my bottom. In a moment or two he was working away at me. As I was very tired and sleepy, I did
          not respond to his movements in the least, so, when he had finished, he said crossly: &quot;Damn it, Dolly,
          you lay just like a log of wood. What's the matter with you?&quot; I said that there was nothing the matter
          with me; that I was only sleepy. He then growled out something uncomplimentary, turned his back to me and went
          to sleep. I speedily did the same. 114</p>

          as usual. While she was brushing my hair, I asked her how she had got on with Mr. Harrington during the hour
          she had spent with him the previous night. She looked at me with a comical expression on her pretty face.
          &quot;Oh, Missus,&quot; she replied, giggling, &quot;I tell you all 'bout it. De ole genterman was no good at
          all. He couldn't do nuffin to me. He try an' he try an' he try. He feel me all over, he play with me with his
          finger an' dat did make me squirm, an' he make me rub him, but it was all no use, his ting would not get stiff
          enough to go into de place. Den he lay me on my face an' say I got a very fine bottom, an' he ask me if de
          Massa often whip it. I told him dat de Massa sometimes whip it. He laugh, den he give me a little spankin' an'
          afterwards he give me two dollars an' say dat I am a pretty wench an' dat he would buy me if de Massa would
          sell me.&quot; I smiled, and Rosa went on: &quot;But, oh Missis, ask de Massa not to sell me to de genterman.
          I'se fond of you now, an' I don't want to leave the ole plantation. I was born on it&quot; I told her that I
          was sure that her master would not fell such a pretty girl to anyone. She seemed pleased and went away with a
          smile on her face. Now I went down to the breakfast room, where I found Randolph. In a short time, the three
          gentlemen; who had stayed in the house all night came into the room: They greeted me politely, without the
          least sign, of embarrassment. But I felt rather uncomfortable when I met their eyes. The cook had sent up an
          excellent breakfast, to which we all did justice. The three girls who waited looked fresh and clean, for
          though 115</p>

        <p>they had taken part; in the races and had been poked, they were not the three who had been kept at work all
          night. When breakfast was over and cigars had been smoked, the buggies were brought round to the terrace. The
          gentlemen then bade me goodbye and smilingly thanked their host for the pleasant night's entertainment Then
          they drove away to their respective homes and Randolph went off to look round the plantation while I betook
          myself to the library and; amused myself with a novel. A few days after the &quot;races,&quot; Randolph found
          that he would have to go to Charleston on some business. Connected with the shipping of his cotton, Dinah was
          told to pack her master's portmanteau with enough clothes for an absence of ten days. On the morning he left
          Woodlands, he spoke to me about the slaves, telling me that I was on no account to interfere with the
          overseers in their management of field hands. But he gave the full authority over all the women and children
          in the house. And he said that, if any of them misbehaved, I could, with Dinah's assistance whip the offender
          myself, or I could send her to the overseers to receive the whipping. In the latter case I was to send a note
          to the man specifying the instrument of punishment which was to be used, whether strap, switch or paddle, and
          also stating the number of strokes which the culprit was to receive. I told Randolph that I would look after
          the women, but I said to myself that I would neither whip them with my own hands nor send one of them to be
          whipped under any circumstances. The idea of grownup women being whipped was intensely repugnant to me, and
          still is. (However, I think that children of both sexes require an occasional spanking.) Randolph went away
          and I was glad to be temporarily my own mistress. It was pleasant to be able to come and go as I pleased and
          not 116</p>

        <p>to be at the beck and call of a master-and Randolph was such, to all intents and purposes. The days passed
          quietly. Dinah was most attentive and I had no trouble with any of the other women. I read a good deal and
          nearly every afternoon I took a long ride in the country on the quiet old horse which Randolph had given me.
          (I had learned to ride pretty well, but I was always rather nervous when I was on horseback.) I also often
          walked about the plantation, watching the field hands at work under the supervision of the overseers, each of
          whom carried a whip. It was the cotton-picking season, the picking being done entirely by women. Every one had
          to pick a certain quantity each day, and, at the hour when work ceased, each picker carried her basket of
          cotton to the weighing shed, where one of the overseers was waiting to check the day's work. Each woman's
          basket was weighed to find out if it contained the right quantity, and, if it did not turn the scale, the
          woman who brought the basket was whipped then and there, receiving twelve strokes. No excuse ever was taken,
          and the punishment always was inflicted with the strap, which gave great pain but did not cut or injure the
          skin. (I once heard an overseer say that he could whip a &quot;nigger&quot; wench's bottom with the strap for
          half an hour without drawing a drop of blood, and that her skin at the end of the time would be as smooth as a
          peeled onion.) There were seventy female field-hands employed in the cotton picking, and nearly every evening
          one or two-and sometimes three or four-would be punished for not bringing in the proper amount. I will give
          you a description of what I once saw, and you must remember that it was almost a daily occurrence, not only on
          Randolph's plantation, but on most, if not all, of the other plantations in the South. I often have heard
          people-not Southerners-defend slavery and say that it was a fine institution, but those people had never seen
          what slavery really was. To this day the thought of slavery makes me indignant. 117</p>

        <p>But to proceed. One evening I was returning from a stroll and happened to be passing near the weighing shed
          just at the hour when work ceased for the day and the women were bringing their baskets of cotton to be
          weighed. I stopped to watch the scene, and, since there was a hedge between the shed and the path where I was
          standing, no one saw me, though I could see through the leafy screen. I knew the rules of the plantation, and,
          as I looked at the women, I hoped for their own sakes that they all had picked their proper weight of cotton.
          They were of all ages, from eighteen up to forty years. Some were married, but most were single. They were of
          various shades; the majority were black, but there were many mulattoes and also several quadroons. All of them
          were strong, healthy-looking women and they were dressed in cotton gowns of diverse colours, their heads, as a
          rule, being covered with brightly-coloured handkerchiefs, though some of the younger and lighter-skinned women
          wore linen sun-bonnets or wide-brimmed straw hats. Everyone had on shoes and stockings. They came along the
          path, carrying their baskets on their heads, chatting and laughing as if they had not a care in the world. But
          I noticed that a few of them were looking rather grave, and I thought to myself that they probably had been
          idling and were not quite sure that they had picked the full weight. The overseer, with a notebook in his hand
          and attended by four field hands, stood in front of the shed, near a large pair of scales. The women came up,
          one by one, each handing her basket to be weighed by the men. If the weight was correct, the overseer ticked
          off the woman's name in his book and she went off to her cabin, free to do what she liked till next morning.
          But if a woman's basket proved to be of short weight, the overseer put a mark against her name and told her to
          remain. The weighing was done quickly. Thus, in a short time, all of the women had gone except six poor things
          whose baskets had been found to be light. They knew what they were going to get, and they stood in a row, 118
        </p>

        <p>all of them looking doleful, while three of them also were whimpering. If I had possessed any authority on
          the plantation, I would have saved the women from the lash. But I had no authority. If I had showed myself to
          the overseer at that moment and asked him to let the culprits off without the regulated punishment, he would
          have laughed at me. The overseer did not make a single remark to the delinquents, nor did they attempt to
          excuse themselves-they knew that no excuse would have saved them. Turning to the woman whose name was first on
          the list, the overseer said sharply: &quot;Lie down.&quot; The woman, without hesitation, extended herself
          upon the ground. Then two of the men knelt in front of her and held her arms stretched out at full length
          while the other two men, also kneeling, held her legs by the ankles. She was a big, very stout, coal-black
          woman, forty years of age. She was married and had two strapping daughters, both of whom were pickers in the
          same gang. The two girls, who were both over twenty years of age and quite black, had brought in their proper
          weight and had walked away a little distance from the shed. But when they saw that their mother had been kept
          back, they stopped, and, standing side by side, looked on in silence while she was being whipped. I dare say
          it was not the first time they had seen such a sight. Members of families, of both sexes, often were whipped
          in each other's presence on Southern plantations. The overseer turned up the woman's scanty garments, which
          consisted only of a skirt, a stiff petticoat and a coarse chemise. Then he scrutinized her great, bare
          posteriors. Her bottom was enormous and so fat that it was dimpled all over. Her thighs were colossal and her
          legs were immense. Her black skin, however, was quite smooth and it shone like polished ebony. The overseer
          took out of his pocket a strap about two and a half feet long, three inches broad, an eighth of an inch thick.
          Then, standing over 119</p>

        <p>the prostrated woman, he gave her twelve sharp strokes. The leather made a loud crack, like the report of a
          pistol, each time it fell on the culprit's great bottom. Tears rolled down the woman's cheeks and her fat
          buttocks quivered, but otherwise she did not move a muscle nor utter the least sound. When the whipping was
          over, she got up and went to her daughters, who put their arms round her. Then the three walked away. I had
          noticed that the broad stripes made by the strap showed a livid colour on her black skin. Next on the list was
          a quadroon-a slim, rather pretty girl not more than eighteen years old. She was in a great fright. Tears were
          running down her cheeks and she was too nervous to place herself in the proper position when ordered.
          &quot;Put her down,&quot; said the overseer. She promptly was seized by the men, and, in a moment, was lying
          flat on the ground with her petticoats up to her shoulders. Her bottom was small, with pear-shaped cheeks. At
          the upper part of her thighs was a small space through which peeped the crisp black hair shading the
          &quot;spot.&quot; She received her dozen strokes, and, though the overseer did not whip her as hard as he had
          whipped the black woman, the girl twisted her loins and squealed loudly from the first stroke to the last.
          When all was over, her olive-skinned little bottom had become a dusky-red colour. She rose to her feet,
          dancing about for a moment in pain. Then she walked stiffly away, wailing loudly, with both hands pressed to
          her bottom. The third culprit was a sturdy mulatto woman, thirty-five years of age. She submissively lay down
          when ordered, and the overseer soon stripped her. She had a big, round, plump bottom. The skin was smooth and
          of a yellowish tint, not at all pretty. The strap cracked, striping her 120</p>

        <p>bottom with twelve red bands and making her wince, wriggle and cry aloud. But she never once screamed. The
          other delinquents-two black women aged respectively twentyseven and thirty years and a mulatto girl aged
          twenty years-were then disposed of by the overseer in the same way. The black women bore their punishment with
          a certain amount of fortitude, but the mulatto girl writhed and squealed, making almost as much outcry as the
          quadroon. I will here state that, from what I saw of whipping during my residence in the South, I came to the
          conclusion that the light-coloured slavewomen had finer skins than the darker-coloured women. Consequently the
          former felt more pain while being whipped than the latter. Moreover, the whipping of such females by men,
          besides being cruel and most indecent, was also, in my opinion, extremely unfair as a punishment. For
          instance, if an octoroon woman and a full-blooded black woman, both of the same age and physique, were to
          undergo exactly the same punishment, the octoroon would suffer far more than the black. When the overseer had
          finished whipping the last culprit and she had gone whimpering away, he told his assistants to go to their
          quarters. Then, rolling up the strap, he put it in his pocket and strolled leisurely away in the direction of
          the overseers' house. (The four men lived together, and I have no doubt they had carnal intercourse with all
          the best looking field-girls.) The man had been perfectly unmoved throughout the whole affair, not appearing
          to be the least excited at seeing the naked bottoms of the women writhing and twisting with seemingly
          lascivious movements under his strokes, and he had whipped the poor creatures with as little compunction as if
          they had been dogs. However, as it was his almost daily work, he was quite accustomed to it, and I don't
          suppose that the cruelty of the enterprise ever struck him. 121</p>

        <p>Slavery had a demoralizing effect upon most of the white people in the South; they hardly looked upon slaves
          as human beings. I often heard white men use the expression &quot;a nigger is no better than a hog.&quot; But
          again I am digressing. 122</p>

        <p>CHAPTER 13 Randolph is detained; Dinah wants a woman whipped; her opinion on the disciplinary power of
          chastisement; cruelty to a cat; my first experience spanking others; the Negro child's codpiece; early puberty
          of the black female; Dinah's delight. By this time everyone had disappeared, and I was alone in the
          fastgathering dusk. My ears still seemed to be ringing with the sharp cracking sound of the strap striking the
          flesh of the women, and I still seemed to hear their cries of pain. I felt pity, but my feelings were not so
          keen as they might have been a few months previously. I had grown accustomed to seeing women whipped, though I
          had never before seen six turned up one after the other. Moreover, since my own shameful whipping and the
          events which had followed, my nature had become hardened. I walked back to the house without meeting anyone,
          and went up to my room, where I found Rosa waiting for me. I changed my dress and bathed my face, then after
          having my hair brushed, I went down to dinner, which I ate with my usual good appetite, though now and then I
          could not help thinking of the scene I had witnessed. After dinner I amused myself with a book until bedtime.
          Next morning I received a letter from Randolph, telling me that business matters would oblige him to go on to
          New Orleans and that he did not know exactly how long he might be detained. The news did not trouble me; I did
          not care for him, so I did not miss him, and I liked the thought of having so many days to myself without
          being poked. A nice quiet embrace in bed at night was all very well, but I disliked being poked by day with
          all my clothes on, and that was what Randolph often did to me. He was a man of strong sensual passions, and
          the least thing inflamed them: a paragraph in a paper, a picture or passage in a book, an unexpected glimpse
          of my ankles, or some other trifle would set him off, and then, in a twinkling I would find myself being
          turned up in some ridiculous position. Now all that was done -for awhile. 123</p>

        <p>After breakfast, I went to the library to answer his letter, and, just as I had finished writing, Dinah,
          looking annoyed, came into the room with a long story of how Emma, one of the mulatto kitchen-girls, had
          lately been neglecting her work. Said Dinah: &quot;I scold her an' I scold her, but she don't mind me one
          little bit, an' dis very mawnin' de ornery nigger wench was sassy to me, who am de housekeeper of
          Woodlands.&quot; (Quadroons always call anyone darker than themselves &quot;niggers.&quot;) She continued:
          &quot;Now Missis, you jus' send for her, I'll take de gal 'up,' and den you give her a good whippin' with de
          switch.&quot; &quot;No, Dinah, I cannot do that,&quot; said I. &quot;Well den, Missis, send her to de
          overseer.&quot; &quot;No, I won't do that either.&quot; Dinah looked very much surprised. She could not
          understand why I would neither whip the girl nor send her to the overseer. &quot;Oh, but, Missis,&quot; she
          said, &quot;if dis yer gal isn't whipped for her sassiness to me, all de other nigger wenches will get sassy
          to me, an' I shan't be able to keep dem in order.&quot; I could hardly keep my countenance on hearing the
          contemptuous way Dinah spoke about &quot;nigger&quot; wenches. Although she was a slave herself, and liable at
          any moment to be whipped if she committed an offence, she had a great idea of her own importance as
          housekeeper of Woodlands. I said: &quot;Wait till Mr. Randolph comes home, then report Emma to him and he will
          very likely punish her.&quot; Dinah was not satisfied with my suggestion, so she remarked that if I did not
          like to whip the girl with the switch or to send her to the overseer, I might at least give her a spanking
          with a slipper. 124</p>

        <p>But I would not consent to do even that, and finally she went away fuming and muttering something about my
          being too easy with &quot;sassy nigger wenches.&quot; A week passed uneventfully. Then a little incident took
          place which annoyed me very much and caused me to do a thing which I never had done before in my Me. I was
          fond of reading out of doors in fine weather, and, one bright afternoon, taking a book, I set off to a
          secluded part of the grounds where there was a little pond full of beautiful water-lilies and surrounded by
          flowering shrubs of various sorts. On the bank of the pond was a creeper-covered summer house, furnished with
          a couple of long, softly-cushioned chairs and a small, round table. The floor was covered with Chinese
          matting. It was a comfortable little place and a favourite resort of mine. On approaching the pond, I saw two
          children busily engaged in throwing stones at something struggling in the water. I knew the children; they
          lived in the house; they were brother and sister, their mother being a fine mulatto woman named Margaret, who
          was one of the kitchen maids, and, since both the boy and the girl were quadroons, their father, whoever he
          was, must have been a white man. The boy was eleven years old, the girl thirteen. They had no business at the
          pond at all, and I expected to see them run away when they caught sight of me, but they were so absorbed in
          what they were doing that they did not notice my approach. When I had got closer to the pond, I saw that the
          object which they were stoning was a kitten, which, as soon as it had managed to struggle to the shore, they
          threw back into the water again to be a target for their stones. I am very fond of all animals, especially
          cats, and any cruelty to a dumb creature always makes my blood boil. So, feeling very angry, I rushed down to
          the edge of the water and, picking up the halfdrowned kitten when it had again managed to reach the shore, I
          125</p>

        <p>placed it on the bank, hoping that the poor thing would recover. But the creature had been injured by the
          stones; it was at its last gasp, and in a few seconds it was dead. I now was more angry than ever, and, going
          to the two children, who had not attempted to run away- not that flight would have saved them-I took them by
          the hand and led them into the summer house, intending to give them both a good spanking. They were slaves and
          belonged to the house. Therefore they were under my authority. And, as I have said before, I think that all
          children need corporal punishment at times. In my opinion, the two children who had stoned the kitten to death
          richly deserved a whipping for their gross crueltythe girl especially, for she was old enough to have known
          better, and it was she who had led her little brother into mischief. I scolded the young wretches heartily,
          winding up by telling them that I was going to give them both a good spanking. They did not appear to be very
          much frightened, but stood staring at me with their large brown eyes, without saying a word. I suppose both
          often had been spanked before, and I knew that, three weeks before, the girl had been well beaten by Dinah, by
          order of Randolph, for pilfering. Sitting down upon a chair, I took off my slippers, then told the boy to come
          to me. He at once obeyed my order. I never had spanked a child, but I remembered the position in which my
          father used to place me for punishment, so, seizing the boy I laid him across my knees. Then I unbuttoned his
          trousers, pulled them down to his calves, and tucked up his shirt, laying bare his posteriors. I gazed at the
          chubby little bottom laying upturned on my lap and passed my hand two or three times over the smooth
          olive-tinted skin. Then a desire came Over me to feel the member of a boy his age, and, slipping my hand under
          his belly, I took hold of his little &quot;thing,&quot; which felt like a thick, warm worm. 126</p>

        <p>Having satisfied my curiosity, I proceeded to business. Holding him down with my left arm over his loins, I
          applied the slipper smartly to his plump little bottom, each, smack leaving a red mark on his skin and
          extracting a howl from him. He kicked up his heels and wriggled about, squealing lustily and trying to roll
          off my lap. But, holding him tightly, I spanked away steadily until the whole surface of his bottom was red.
          Then I stopped and placed him kneeling on the floor with his trousers down and his bottom turned towards me,
          telling him not to move till I gave him permission. He did not attempt to stir but remained where I had put
          him, crying loudly, his fists in his eyes. His little red buttocks shook with the sobs. While I had been
          spanking the boy, his sister had looked on with a perfectly unmoved countenance, and, when I told her to come
          to me, she did so without hesitation. Taking hold of her, I placed her in position, saying to myself that I
          would make her show some signs of feeling before I was done with her. I whisked up her short and scanty
          garments, at once bearing her bottom (for she wore no drawers). Every thing she had on was perfectly clean.
          Though the girl was only a little over thirteen years of age, she was remarkably well developed. Before taking
          her up I had noticed that her bosom was already showing a slight swell under her thin bodice, and now, upon
          looking at her bottom, I was quite astonished at its size. It was well-shaped, too. The plump, firm cheeks
          stood out in rounded curves; her thighs also were fairly well rounded, and she had good legs for so young a
          girl. Her skin was soft and smooth and of a pretty olive tint. Putting my hand under her, I touched the
          &quot;spot,&quot; and, finding that there was a good deal of downy hair on it, I felt pretty sure that the
          girl had come to puberty. (Quadroons, and, in fact, all females with Negro blood in their veins become
          marriageable at an early age.) I began to spank her, laying the slipper with considerable force, making her
          wince and writhe. She bore several smacks in silence, then 127</p>

        <p>bursting into tears, she began to squeal and kick, at the same time putting both hands behind her to shield
          her bottom from the hot slaps. Catching hold of her wrists, I held them tightly with my left hand and went on
          spanking her. She wriggled and twisted, and she bounced and bawled. Her olive skin grew redder and redder
          every moment, while the summer house echoed with her shrill squeals and with the smacking noise made by the
          slipper as it struck her bottom, the flesh of which was as firm and elastic as possible. I felt no pity for
          the cruel little girl. Quite oblivious to her cries and entreaties for mercy, I gave her the soundest spanking
          she ever had had. When the punishment was over, her bottom, from the loins to the thighs, was a dark red
          colour. Now I made her kneel beside her brother and hold her petticoats above her waist. Then I put on my
          slipper and leaned back in the chair, taking breath after my exertions, which had been considerable. While
          resting, I looked at the red marks of my handiwork on the children's bottoms. The boy had ceased crying, but
          he still sobbed at intervals, while the girl, who must have been smarting dreadfully, wailed aloud. After a
          short time, I told them that they might go, and they at once stood up, tears trickling down their cheeks, the
          girl letting her petticoats fall and the boy buttoning up his trousers. Then they slunk out of the summer
          house and went off home. Feeling quite a glow of satisfaction at having punished the naughty children, I made
          myself comfortable, with my legs up on the chair, and began to read the novel which I had brought with me. I
          read quietly for about an hour, then went back to the house. That evening after dinner, when I was sitting in
          the small, cosy drawing room, Dinah came in to ask what I wished done in connection with some household
          affairs. When I had given her my directions, she did not go away, but stood 128</p>

        <p>fidgeting about and looking at me as if she wanted to say something. &quot;What do you want, Dinah?&quot; I
          asked. &quot;I don't want nuthin' Missis,&quot; she replied. &quot;But I want to tell you how glad I is dat
          you spanked dose drefful chillen dis afternoon. De kitten de little beasts killed belonged to me.&quot;
          &quot;How did you come to know that I had spanked them?&quot; I inquired. &quot;Oh, dey came home cryin' and
          rubbin' deir bottoms, an' dey tole us dat de Missis had given dem a spankin' in de summer house for trowin'
          stones at de kitten.&quot; I smiled, and asked Dinah if she knew who was the father of the children. She knew
          everything connected with Woodlands, and she informed me that the father was a white man who had at one time
          been an overseer on the plantation. I then asked her several more questions, and, since she was always ready
          to chatter to me on the least encouragement, I heard some very curious stories about the doings of slave women
          and girls. She also gave me many particulars which I had not heard before about herself and the Randolph
          family. Dinah was very fond of hearing herself speak, and she used a great many more words than were
          necessary, so I will only give you a summary of what she told me. She was exactly the same age as Randolph,
          both having been born on the same day, thirty-five years back. Her mother had been Randolph's nurse, and the
          two children had been brought up together and had played with each other in their young days. When George grew
          to boyhood, he became the young master and she had to submit to all his caprices. He was the only child and
          his parents spoiled him, allowing him to do what he liked. He was very precocious, and, before he was fifteen
          years of age, he had begun to feel her. Whenever she offended him, he would throw her down upon the floor,
          turn up her petticoats and spank her. 129</p>

        <p>When they were eighteen years of age, he took her maidenhead. Then he continued to possess her whenever he
          felt inclined, for three years. After this, he went to Europe. He was away for a couple of years, and, after
          his return, he had further carnal relations with her only occasionally. When Dinah was twenty-five, she got
          married to a quadroon man a few years older than she. From that time, Randolph had never touched her. But, as
          she pithily expressed it: &quot;Massa George had plenty of oder gals in de house.&quot; When Randolph was
          thirty years old, his father and mother died within a short time of each other and he became master of
          Woodlands. When that event occurred, Dinah was a widow and was head parlour maid. Randolph made her
          housekeeper and gave her a certain amount of authority over the other slave women. Of course he had never
          hesitated to whip her if she happened to displease him; it was, however, nearly two years now since she had
          received a whipping. Dinah, having started, would have gone on chattering all night about Woodlands and its
          people. But as I was beginning to feel very sleepy, I sent her away and went to bed. 130</p>

        <p>CHAPTER 14 I learn something of Randolph's previous copulating proclivities; I go for a ride and am rogered
          in my tight-fitting riding dress; spanked and rogered again; I respond to his lunges and give the Southern
          Bluebeard satisfaction. Next morning I received a letter from Randolph informing me that he would be home in
          three days and telling me to have a good dinner ready for him at the usual hour, with gumbo soup, stewed
          terrapin and roasted canvasback ducks. He was very fond of those three things, two of which-gumbo soup and
          stewed terrapin-can be got in perfection only in the Southern States. Sending for Dinah, I told her that her
          master was coming back and I gave her orders about the dinner, also telling her to warn the cook and the
          kitchen-women to be careful. Randolph, being a great gourmet, was most particular about the cooking of
          everything, and if a cook, through carelessness, spoiled a dish, her bottom was generally made to smart. After
          lunch on the day Randolph was to return, I interviewed Dinah, who told me that she had got the terrapin and
          the canvasback ducks and that the cooks were preparing a very good dinner. It was only two o'clock, and, since
          I did not expect Randolph to be home until six, I thought I would go out for a ride. I knew that he would
          scold me if he did not find me dressed for dinner and waiting in the drawing room to receive him. So, after
          ordering my horse to be brought to the terrace, I went up to my room, and, assisted by Rosa, dressed in full
          riding costume-a short chemise reaching to my knees and a dark blue habit. On my head I wore a soft felt hat
          of tan colour, and I had tan gauntlets on my hands. Rosa always was amused when she was helping me to dress in
          riding costume, and, on this occasion, while buttoning my breeches round my broad hips, she laughed, saying,
          &quot;Oh Missis, how funny you does look 131</p>

        <p>in dem tight trousies. Dey does show de shape of your figure, an' no mistake.&quot; However, when I was
          completely attired, the girl gazed admiringly at me, remarking that I looked &quot;real lubly.&quot; And I
          think that I may say without conceit that I did look well in riding costume. I went downstairs and out on the
          terrace, where one of the Negro grooms was walking my horse up and down. The horse was getting old, but he was
          a very handsome creature, a thoroughbred &quot;dark bay&quot; with black &quot;points.&quot; He knew me well,
          for I used to visit him every day, giving him bits of bread, lumps of sugar and slices of carrot, of all of
          which he was very fond. The groom put me up on the saddle, then I trotted off alone. (I never took a man with
          me.) It was a bright, cool day, the old horse was frisky but perfectly under my control, and, as he ambled
          with an easy action along the smooth, level road, the breeze fanned my cheeks, bringing an increased colour to
          them. My eyes began to sparkle and I felt in very good spirits. I rode seven miles to a farm house, where I
          dismounted and had a glass of milk while the old horse had a bucket of meal and water. Then, after a short
          rest, I again mounted and rode slowly back to Woodlands, arriving at five o'clock. The groom was waiting for
          me on the terrace, and, as he helped me down from the saddle, he told me that &quot;de Massa&quot; had been
          back about an hour. Hurrying into the house, I went straight to the drawing room, where I found Randolph lying
          on the sofa. &quot;Oh, George!&quot; I exclaimed. &quot;I am sorry I was not in when you returned. But I did
          not think that you would be home until six o'clock.&quot; 132</p>

        <p>I expected that he would be very cross with me for not having been waiting for him. But, to my great relief,
          he was in good humour. &quot;Never mind, Dolly,&quot; he said. &quot;It doesn't matter.&quot; Then, getting
          off the sofa, he lifted me up in his arms and kissed me on the forehead in a gentle affectionate way. (He
          seldom kissed me, and, when he did, his kisses generally were coarse and sensual.) I was surprised at his soft
          manner and tender kiss, and I thought to myself that, if only he would treat me more as a woman and less as a
          subject for the gratification of his passions, I might get to like him a little. But his soft mood did not
          last many moments. I saw the sensual look, which I knew so well, come into his eyes as they roved over the
          curves of my bosom and the outlines of my hips, which were clearly defined by my tightly-fitting habit. After
          a moment, he said: &quot;You are looking very fresh and rosy, and your habit does show off your figure to
          perfection. In fact you look so nice that I am going to 'have' you this minute, just as you stand.&quot;
          &quot;Oh!&quot; I exclaimed, rather taken aback. &quot;That will be very uncomfortable. I've got on breeches
          and boots. Come to my room and let me take them off.&quot; &quot;No, I won't go to your room,&quot; he said
          laughing. &quot;I intend to keep you here and poke you just as you are. I've 'had' women in all sorts of dress
          and undress, but I've never 'had' one in full riding costume. It will be a decided novelty; therefore my
          pleasure will be increased. I've not touched a woman since I left you. Now take off your hat and gloves, but
          don't remove anything else.&quot; When I first had seen him that afternoon, I was not disinclined for a poke,
          for there had been three weeks abstinence and, if he had taken me quietly up to my room, had let me undress
          and then had poked me properly on the bed, I should have been quite pleased. But now I was annoyed by the
          coarse way in which he had spoken, and I disliked having to submit to his embraces while dressed as I was.
          However, I 133</p>

        <p>knew that it would be useless to remonstrate. So, taking off my hat and gloves, I waited for his next move.
          He took off his coat and waistcoat, then made me lean over the back of a low, broad armchair with my hands
          resting on the seat. (I was not surprised, for he often had placed me over a chair before.) He next rolled up
          the skirt of my habit to my shoulders, and, since my body was curved by the position in which I was leaning,
          my bottom was well stuck out and my breeches tightly stretched. After a little fumbling under my corset, he
          unbuttoned the breeches and with some difficulty pulled them down to the tops of my boots. Then he carefully
          tucked up my chemise, leaving me bare to the attack. He always was fond of looking at me and feeling my
          bottom, so he stroked it, saying: &quot;Why, Dolly, your bottom seems to be plumper, prettier and whiter than
          ever, but I am going to redden it with a little spanking.&quot; When I heard him say this, I was frightened.
          He never had offered to do such a thing to me before. Raising my head, and looking over my shoulder I said in
          a pleading tone: &quot;Oh, don't spank me. I can't bear pain.&quot; But I did not attempt to move from the
          position he had placed me in. Somehow or other, I never could resist his will. &quot;I won't hurt you,&quot;
          he said. &quot;I'll only make you feel a pleasant tingling sensation.&quot; He then began to spank me; not
          with much force, but yet sufficiently hard to cause my skin to tingle more than I liked, and he applied the
          slaps to one side of my bottom only, leaving he other side quite untouched. When he had spanked the whole
          surface of one buttock from the upper part down to the thigh, he stopped, saying with a laugh: &quot;There,
          Dolly. One cheek is pink as a rose and the other is white as a lily. The contrast is charming. It is a pity
          that you cannot see for yourself.&quot; 134</p>

        <p>Then, going to work again, he spanked the white cheek until it also turned a rosy pink. But I can't say that
          I felt only a pleasant tingling sensation; in point of fact, my bottom decidedly smarted. But, strange to say,
          the slight spanking had excited a voluptuous feeling in me and I was anxious to receive the stroke. Randolph
          now unbuttoned his trousers. Then, making me separate my legs slightly, he clasped his arms round my body and,
          stooping a little, thrust his &quot;thing&quot; into the &quot;spot&quot; between the cleft of the thighs.
          Holding me in a close embrace with his belly pressed against my bottom, he began to lunge at me strongly,
          giving me the full length of his member, while I, pressing my thighs together, clipped the weapon tightly in
          the sheath, at the same time moving my loins briskly backwards and forwards to meet his powerful thrusts. He
          worked away in fine style, and I gave him every assistance. Thus, in a few seconds, the supreme spasm arrived.
          He discharged copiously, while I squirmed and twisted myself about, wriggling my bottom in voluptuous ecstasy
          until all was over. Then my knees gave way under me and I should have fallen had he not held me up. &quot;That
          was a good one, Dolly, wasn't it,&quot; said he, helping me to my feet. &quot;You did your part very
          well.&quot; I smiled, and, pulling up my breeches, buttoned them round my waist, while he fastened the front
          of his trousers and put on his coat and waistcoat. I do not know whether during his absence he had touched a
          woman or not, but the poke he gave me that day was the most vigorous I ever had received from him. (Since that
          time I have learned by experience that all men are fanciful; they like change, and are fond of &quot;making
          love&quot; to women in all sorts of ways. But women do not care to be &quot;had&quot; in fancy positions with
          their clothes on; they prefer to be embraced in the old-fashioned way, lying on their backs in or on a
          comfortable bed, with nothing on but a chemise or a nightdress.) 135</p>

        <p>The welcoming party over, Randolph and I went to our respective rooms and dressed for dinner, meeting each
          other at the table at seven o'clock. It was an excellent repast. The cooks had done their best, and the gumbo
          soup, stewed terrapin and roast canvasback ducks were cooked to perfection. Since we both were hungry, we did
          full justice to the various dishes, and also to the champagne and other wines. Randolph asked me how the women
          had behaved during his absence, and I replied that they had not given me the least trouble. Then I told him
          how I had spanked the two children for killing the kitten. He was very much amused, laughing heartily at my
          description of the affair, and he said that I was such a meek little creature that he did not think that I
          would have had the courage to whip the children singlehanded. 136</p>

        <p>CHAPTER 15 &quot;Spoon fashion&quot;; the irony of woman's destiny; I am futtered in the place where, when a
          virgin, I defended my honour; the calm is broken; Dinah receives an awful spanking; her majestic bottom. After
          dinner, when we were in the drawing room, Randolph told me that he was having great trouble with his business
          matters, owing to the unsettled state of affairs between the North and South. Randolph, like all Southerners
          at that period, hated the Northerners, speaking of them most contemptuously and calling them &quot;damned
          Yankees.&quot; He said also that he did not think that they would dare to push matters to extremes with the
          South. Being a Yankee myself, I did not like to hear Yankees spoken of with such contempt, and I felt
          convinced in my own mind that they would be quite able to hold their own with the Southerners. However, I did
          not argue the point. I had long given up trying to argue with Randolph, for, whenever I attempted to hold an
          opinion different to his, he always told me that I did not know what I was talking about, and to &quot;shut
          up.&quot; The evening passed, and, at eleven o'clock, we went to bed; but before going to sleep he made me lie
          on my side while he, also on his side, lay behind me with his arms round me and his bare belly pressed close
          against my naked bottom, so that his stiff member passed between my thighs and into my cleft. Then, grasping
          one of my breasts in each of his hands, he poked me. This was a favourite position of his. He used to call it
          &quot;spoon position.&quot; Next morning after breakfast he went out to make an inspection of the plantation
          to see how things had been carried out during his absence. He found everything in good order, so he came back
          to lunch in a good humour and, when it was over, he ordered the two-horse buggy and we went for a drive. It
          was a bright, hot afternoon, so he drove through the shadiest lanes and we happened to pass the little dell
          where he had made the assault 137</p>

        <p>on me. Pulling up the horses and pointing with his whip to the spot, he said with a laugh: &quot;Do you
          remember this place, Dolly?&quot; I did remember it well! And I thought of the long and desperate struggle
          which I had waged to keep my maidenhead, which, after all, I had to surrender to him. &quot;Oh, I remember the
          place very well,&quot; I replied. &quot;Do you think I possibly could forget it?&quot; He again laughed,
          saying: &quot;How you did kick and scream and fight! You quite astonished me. I would not have believed that a
          little woman like you could have made such a strong resistance. It was an exciting struggle and the thought of
          it has given me an erection, so I intend to have a roll on the grass with you.&quot; I said nothing, but I
          thought a great deal. I was going to be rogered on the very spot where I once had successfully resisted his
          assault. It surely was the very irony of ironies. Randolph got out of the buggy and hitched the horses to a
          tree. Then, lifting me down, he carried me to the little hollow and laid me on the grass. After some amorous
          dalliance, he placed me in the position, turned up my petticoats and poked me strongly, making me bounce under
          him. &quot;Ah, Dolly,&quot; he remarked when all was over, &quot;if you had let me get on the top of you that
          day, you would not have had your bottom whipped by the lynchers nor would you have ridden the rail.&quot; I
          made no answer, but arranged my somewhat disordered attire. Then we got back into the buggy and continued our
          interrupted drive, not returning home until it was time to dress for dinner. The days passed and everything
          went smoothly. The women of Woodlands gave no one any great trouble. Their conduct was so good that not a
          single one of them since Randolph's return had had her petticoats turned up. 138</p>

        <p>I mean, of course, turned up for a whipping. I have no doubt that most of them, if not all, had their
          petticoats turned up for a poke in the evenings. Plenty of love-making went on, for a certain number of the
          women and girls, in turns, were allowed to be out every night till halfpast ten o'clock. Anyone who was late
          in returning to the house was brought by Dinah the next morning before Randolph, who either whipped the
          offender himself or sent her to the overseer. And the culprit was further punished by not being allowed out of
          the house at night for a month. So it was very seldom that a woman stayed out beyond the hour fixed for
          return. But the calm which had lasted for so many days was one afternoon ruffled by a breeze. I think that
          something had gone wrong on the plantation. I don't know what it was, but, whatever the case, Randolph, who
          had been out for a couple of hours, came back to the house in a vile temper. He upbraided me because I
          happened to be wearing a pair of easy slippers without heels, asking me what the devil I meant by going about
          slipshod &quot;like an untidy nigger wench.&quot; When he had quieted down a little, he informed me that he
          had a business appointment with a gentleman -one of the neighbouring planters-and that they were to meet each
          other in an hour and a half's time at a certain crossroad a few miles from Woodlands. He then reached for the
          bell to give orders for his horse to be saddled, when Dinah happened to come into the room to ask me a
          question about dinner. I answered her question, and, as she was leaving the room, Randolph told her to order
          his horse to be brought round at once. He then went up to dress, returning in about half an hour's time in
          riding costume. The groom, however, had not made his appearance with the horse, so Randolph kept walking up
          and down the room, fuming with impatience, constantly glancing at his watch and every now and then looking out
          of the window, wondering why the horse had not been brought, saying that he would most likely miss his
          appointment, and 139</p>

        <p>vowing that, if he did, he would have the groom cowhided by the overseer. At last he rang the bell furiously,
          telling the parlour maid who answered to send Dinah up. When the girl had left the room, he turned to me
          saying: &quot;I think that confounded woman must have forgotten to send word to the stables,&quot; Presently
          Dinah, looking calm and placid, came into the room. &quot;Did you order my horse?&quot; shouted Randolph in an
          angry voice. A frightened expression at once appeared on the woman's face. &quot;No Sah, I didn't; I quite
          forgot dat you tole me to order de hoss,&quot; she answered in a faint voice, glancing deprecatingly at her
          angry master. He flew into a violent passion. The veins of his forehead swelled and his eyes gleamed with
          rage. &quot;Oh, you forgot, did you?&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;Ill teach you to forget my orders!&quot;
          Rushing at Dinah, who stood cowering, he seized her, and, sitting down on the end of the sofa, threw the great
          big woman across his knees, just as if she had been a little girl. I could see by her astonished face that she
          was taken utterly aback, but she did not struggle. Ejaculating once, &quot;Oh, Massa!&quot; she lay quietly
          over Randolph's thighs with her hands resting on the floor at one side of him and her feet on the other. With
          one sweep of his arm, Randolph threw her petticoats up over her head, completely hiding her face and laying
          her bare from her waist to her garters. Dinah, being a tall, strapping woman, had large posteriors; her bottom
          really was splendid-broad, deep and very plump-and, since she was lying in a much curved position, the great
          half-moons were raised high on Randolph's lap. She had large, round, muscular thighs and the plump calves of
          her big legs seemed ready to burst through her tight, white cotton stockings. Her dusky olive skin was smooth
          and wholesome looking, and all her drapery was clean. 140</p>

        <p>Holding her firmly in position with his left arm over her naked loins and with his right leg over the lower
          part of her thighs, &quot;de Massa now began to spank the woman, raising his hand as high as he could in the
          air and laying on the strokes with his full force. Each time his hand fell on her big bottom, a loud
          &quot;smack&quot; echoed through the room and the red prints of his fingers and thumb instantly showed on her
          skin. Dinah winced under the stinging slaps, her plump flesh twitching and quivering. But she did not utter a
          sound, nor did she attempt to put her hands behind her. Randolph went on spanking her ruthlessly, and, after a
          moment, she shook her head clear of her petticoats and looked round with a pleading expression in her great,
          brown, ox-like eyes. Her cap had fallen off, her hair had come loose, her lips were quivering, the tears were
          rolling down her cheeks and she writhed and twisted her loins in pain, but still she was silent. &quot;De
          Massa&quot; continued to rain down the shower of slaps, the red marks of his fingers spreading all over her
          bottom till not a part of it was left unmarked. Dinah's fortitude at last gave way. She began to utter little
          shrieks and to kick her legs about. She jerked her hips from side to side, and, putting her hands over her
          bottom, tried in vain to shield it from the tremendous spanking, at the same time gasping out entreaties to
          Randolph to stop. At last he stopped and pushed the woman off his knees onto the floor, where she lay crying
          with her petticoats still up to her waist so that her great, red bottom remained exposed. After a moment or
          two Dinah got to her feet, wiping the tears from her hot, flushed face with her apron. Then she twisted up her
          hair and, picking up her cap, put it on her head, but not very straight. This done, she shook her petticoats
          into their places and stood sobbing before her master. &quot;There, you careless hussy,&quot; he said. &quot;I
          think you'll remember my orders in future. Go away.&quot; 141</p>

        <p>Dinah, holding her apron to her eyes, walked rather stiffly out of the room. Randolph rubbed the palm of his
          hand, saying: &quot;Damn the thing, I have made my band quite sore on the woman's bottom. Her flesh is very
          firm, and I felt as if I were spanking a board. I ought to have used the switch and saved my hand. But,&quot;
          he added, &quot;if my hand is so sore, what must her bottom be? I fancy she won't forget that spanking in a
          hurry.&quot; &quot;I think it was a shame that you spanked Dinah at all,&quot; I observed. The laughing
          expression instantly left his face and he glared furiously at me, saying in a loud, angry tone: &quot;You had
          better keep what you think to yourself. It is no business of yours what I do to my slaves.&quot; &quot;I'm
          sorry,&quot; I apologized. &quot;Why damn it,&quot; he continued with increased anger; &quot;no one has ever
          dared to make such a remark to me before. I have a great mind to take you across my knees and give you a smart
          spanking too.&quot; My blood ran cold, and a lump came into my throat. He was quite capable of doing what he
          said. &quot;Oh, I beg your pardon. I am very sorry I spoke,&quot; I said earnestly. &quot;So you ought to be.
          I thought you knew by this time that I will stand no interference,&quot; he said scowling at me. Then, much to
          my relief, he left the room. Shortly afterwards I saw him canter down the avenue. I was very sorry for poor
          Dinah. She always had been most attentive to me, and I liked her very much. I wondered how Randolph had the
          heart to expose and whip so severely the woman who had been his foster-sister, and who had lived all her life
          in the house with him and who also had been the toy of his passions. Feeling rather upset by the scene and
          also by my narrow escape from a spanking, I went to my room, and ringing for Rosa, told her to take down my
          hair and give it a good brushing, a thing which always has a soothing effect upon me. 142</p>

        <p>The news that Dinah had been spanked had already got about the house. She was not liked by her fellow slaves,
          because, as housekeeper, she kept them in order, reporting any woman or girl who misbehaved or who neglected
          her work. Rosa brushed away at my hair for a few moments in silence, but I could see that she was bursting to
          say something, and at last she said: &quot;All de women is glad dat Dinah got a good spankin' from de Massa.
          She tinks too much ob herself. An' she always tells on a gal if she don't do exactly right, an' gets her a
          whippin'.&quot; &quot;Dinah only does her duty,&quot; I remarked. &quot;If the girls and women always behaved
          as well as they have been doing lately, Dinah would not have to tell on any of them.&quot; Rosa tossed her
          head, but made no further remarks, and, when she had brushed my hair well and re-arranged it, I sent her away,
          telling her to send Dinah up to me. I was rather curious to see how she was after her terrible spanking. In a
          short time she came into the room, looking as smart and tidy as ever. Her hair was neatly arranged under a
          clean cap and she had put on a clean apron, collar and cuffs. Her face wore its usual placid look, but her
          eyelids were red and rather swollen. &quot;I am sorry for you, Dinah,&quot; I said. &quot;Your master spanked
          you so very severely.&quot; She seemed to be a little surprised at my expression of sympathy, but she was very
          grateful for it and she thanked me. Then she said, &quot;I'se had plenty of spank-ins' an' whippins' in my
          life, but I never thought dat I'd come to be spanked again like a little gal. Why, Missis, I ain't had such a
          ting done to me since I was thirteen years ole. But, oh my! Dis one was a spankin'! It hurt most drefful. De
          Massa laid on powerful heavy, an' his hand is very hard. I'se been paddled twice, but I tink de Massa's 143
        </p>

        <p>hand hurt me today near as much as de paddle did. My bottom is very sore an' bruised, an' it'll be black an'
          blue all over tomorrow.&quot; Dinah had spoken without emotion. She evidently did not think it strange that a
          woman of her age should have been whipped in such an ignominious way, and she did not appear to bear her
          master the least malice. She was his slave, her body belonged to him, therefore he could do what he liked with
          it. Such was the degrading effect of slavery on the minds of the slaves. I sent her away and dressed for
          dinner, putting on a new frock which I lately had received from the dressmaker in Richmond. Then I went down
          to the dining room, where I found Randolph. Since dinner was ready we sat down to table. He had missed his
          appointment, he said, and it was an important one. Consequently he was very cross and snappish. But, after he
          had eaten a good dinner, drunk a bottle of champagne and smoked a cigar, he got into a better humour. When we
          went into the drawing room, he seated himself in an easy chair, saying to me waggishly: 'Come here, Dolly, and
          let me see if you have taken off those beastly slippers you were wearing this afternoon.&quot; I went to him
          and held my skirts above my knees, while he looked at my feet and legs. I had on a pretty pair of high-heeled
          boots and pale blue silk stockings fastened with silver-buckled, pink satin garters. &quot;Ah, this is
          something I like,&quot; he observed, running his hand up and down my legs and ankles. Then he put his hand
          higher up under my drapery, and, opening the slit of my drawers, felt my bottom. &quot;You are looking very
          pretty tonight, Dolly, and that new frock becomes you,&quot; he went on, drawing me closer to him while his
          eyes began to sparkle. 144</p>

        <p>I knew what he was going to do! Taking me up in his arms, he carried me to the sofa and laid me upon it. Then
          he turned up my garments one by one, looking at my fine white petticoats deeply flounced with lace, my
          prettily trimmed drawers and my filmy chemise. (He always made me wear the daintiest undergarments in the
          evening.) When everything had been turned up and my drawers had been taken down, he stretched my legs widely
          apart and gazed for a moment or two at the &quot;spot.&quot; Then, inserting his finger, he tickled the
          sensitive little &quot;point&quot; till it distilled a few drops of moisture, while I squirmed and kicked my
          legs. He seemed to be very much excited, kissing me hotly on the lips, eyes and cheeks several times. Then,
          throwing himself upon me, he pressed his lips upon mine and thrust his tongue into my mouth Next, putting his
          hands under me and grasping the cheeks of my bottom, he fixed his weapon deeply in the sheath and
          &quot;sworded&quot; me vigorously. When all was over and we had made ourselves tidy, he rang the bell and
          ordered the parlour maid to bring a bottle of champagne. When the girl had brought the wine, we soon disposed
          of it, as our exciting combat had made us both thirsty. Randolph was pleased with himself and he was also
          pleased with me, so he was in very good humour. We had a long conversation on various subjects, and, since he
          did not snub me when I differed with him, I passed a more pleasant evening than usual. At half-past eleven
          o'clock we went to bed. 145</p>

        <p>CHAPTER 16 After four months; the &quot;spirit of unrest&quot;; my sympathies are with the North; an escaped
          Negress is taken and flogged; a most awful flagellation; &quot;paddling described; a blistered bottom. I will
          now pass over a period of four months. During that time, events had been marching rapidly and stirring things
          had happened. The slave States had seceded from the Union. Jeff Davis had been elected president of the
          Southern Confederacy. Fort Sumter had been taken, and the war had begun. All those events are matters of
          history, so I need not enter into details of them. I will confine myself to relating the things which were
          connected with Woodlands and with my own fortunes. The work on the plantation was carried on as usual,
          notwithstanding the very unsettled state of affairs. But there was a spirit of unrest among all the field
          hands, and they were inclined to be insubordinate. Randolph and his four overseers always went about armed
          with revolvers, and whippings were of more frequent occurrence than ever. The overseers in all cases inflicted
          the punishments, the male slaves being tied to the whipping post and cowhided while the females were stretched
          upon a branch and either switched or paddled. By these severe means, discipline so far had been thoroughly
          maintained. The house-women, of course, rarely became very troublesome. But Randolph would stand no nonsense.
          He became stricter with them than before, and, whenever a woman or a girl had misbehaved in the least, Dinah
          and another stalwart woman named Milly were sent for and the offender was taken &quot;up&quot; and prepared
          for punishment. Then, in a few seconds, she would be squealing, writhing, kicking up her heels and promising
          amendment, while Randolph, wielding the switch with vigorous arm, striped her bottom with red weals. In some
          cases of grave 146</p>

        <p>misconduct, he would even draw blood. This treatment reduced to order all who were inclined to be unruly, and
          they soon returned to their ordinary behaviour. For some time past, business in the State had been almost at a
          standstill. Therefore Randolph could not dispose of his cotton, which had accumulated in the sheds which were
          full to overflowing. He was a rich man, but most of his income was derived from the sale of his cotton, and,
          now that there was no market for it -while, at the same time, the great expenses in keeping up the plantation
          were going onhe became very much pressed for ready money. However, he thought that it would only be a
          temporary inconvenience, for he was quite convinced that the South eventually would prove victorious in the
          war. My sympathies, of course, were with the Northerners, and I wished them speedy success. But I dared not
          express my sentiments. I really don't know what Randolph would have done to me if I had said what I thought.
          Meanwhile, he rarely left the plantation and he never gave any dinner parties. All his friends either had left
          the State or had joined the Confederate Army. He would have done so himself except that he was too old to go
          as a private soldier and he was unable to get a commission as an officer, owing to his having no knowledge of
          military affairs. But he had been elected member of Congress for the Southern Confederacy. Since he would not
          leave Woodlands, my lover was obliged to fall back exclusively upon my company, and he seemed glad to have it.
          He seemed also to appreciate it. His manner became a little more tender, he did not speak to me so coarsely-as
          he often had been in the habit of doing-and he treated me with less indecency. But with his slaves, both
          outdoor and indoor, he was more strict than ever. Since the breaking out of the war, several of the field
          hands had 147</p>

        <p>run away and had managed to get clear off, although the &quot;underground stations&quot; had been closed.
          Randolph had offered twohundred dollars reward for the capture of each runaway, but not one of them had been
          brought back. These losses had vexed him very much, the runaways having been some of his strongest and finest
          young men and women, each of whom was worth from fifteen-hundred to twothousand dollars. So far none of the
          house women had run away, but at last one of them did. One morning when Randolph and I were at breakfast,
          Dinah came in and told her master that one of the women named Sophie, who had been out the previous night, had
          not returned to the house, and that some other girls reported that she had taken away some of her clothes.
          Sophie was one of the kitchen-maids, a fine, big, healthy mulatto woman, twenty-six years of age and worth
          about eighteen-hundred dollars. There was no doubt that she had run Way, so Randolph at once wrote out copies
          of advertisements, describing the woman and offering the large reward of four-hundred dollars to anyone
          bringing her back to Woodlands or lodging her in a jail. He sent the advertisement to all the local
          newspapers, and he also ordered bills to be printed and posted up in various places. Several days passed. The
          advertisements appeared in the papers and the bills were stuck up all about the neighbourhood. But nothing was
          heard of the runaway. However, since all the white loafers were eager to secure the large reward, Randolph had
          high hopes that the woman would be caught sooner or later. And she was. About five o'clock one evening, a
          couple of rough-looking white men drove up to the house in a ramshackle wagon, bringing with them the runaway,
          whom they had found concealed in the slave quarter of a plantation twenty miles from Woodlands. The woman,
          whose wrists were tied together with a piece of rope, evidently had not suffered any privations during the
          time she had been absent. Her frock was clean and she was in good condition bodily, although her face was
          looking 148</p>

        <p>very doleful, for she knew that there was a severe whipping awaiting her. The men who had hunted her down
          received the four-hundred dollars bounty and drove off in their wagon, while Sophie was taken away to the
          servants' quarters. After she had been given something to eat, she was locked up in a small bedroom by herself
          for the night. Randolph was very much pleased at having got the woman back, consequently he was in a very good
          humour all through the evening. So, when we were in the drawing room after dinner, I ventured to ask him what
          he intended to do to Sophie. &quot;Never you mind, Dolly,&quot; he replied, smiling. &quot;It's no business of
          yours. I've not quite made up my mind what I shall do to her, but anyhow, I tend to make the hussy smart
          tomorrow, and, if you like, you can see the punishment.&quot; I asked no more questions, and he told me to
          come and sit on his knee. I did so Then, as a matter of course, the usual toyings took place, and, in a very
          short time, I found myself &quot;impaled&quot; as I sat on his lap. Afterwards we talked about the war and I
          had carefully to conceal my real opinions. In due course we went to bed. Next morning at breakfast, my hero
          told me that he had determined to make an example of Sophie. Therefore he intended to whip her with the
          paddle. The punishment would be meted out in the hall, before all the other women in the house. I was sorry
          for Sophie-(I always was sorry when a woman was whipped)-but I dared not say a word. In fact, if I had said
          anything, it only would have irritated Randolph and made him harder on the women. Moreover, it would have
          brought his wrath upon me. When he had finished his breakfast and had smoked a cigar, he left the room to make
          preparations for the punishment. In about twenty 149</p>

        <p>minutes he came back and said: &quot;Everything is ready now. You can come out to the hall if you would like
          to see a paddling.&quot; I had seen many women switched. I had seen some whipped with the strap, and I had
          seen several spanked. But I had never seen one paddled, and I was rather curious as to how the punishment was
          inflicted. Thus, I followed Randolph to the hall. I was sorry for the woman, as I have before said, but my
          curiosity overcame my pity. I had grown somewhat callous. In the middle of the long, wide hall was a machine
          which I never had seen before, though I had heard of it. It was the whipping bench-a long, low, curved wooden
          structure about two feet broad, supported on four legs, each of which war furnished with buckled straps. On
          the floor beside the bench was the paddle, a round, flat piece of wood an eighth of an inch thick and eight
          inches in diameter, fixed to a handle two and a half feet long. It was very much dreaded by all the female
          slaves, for it caused great pain, bruising the flesh and blistering the skin so that, after a paddling, the
          sufferer's bottom remained sore and tender longer than after a switching or a strapping. All the women and
          grown-up girls in the house were present. They were twenty-one in number, ten of them in a row at one side of
          the bench and ten at the other, while Dinah stood by herself. Randolph ordered Dinah and Milly-a strong black
          woman whom I have mentioned before-to go for the culprit. They went, returning in a couple of minutes with
          Sophie, who, the moment she caught sight of the preparations for her paddling, burst into tears and hung back
          in such a fashion that the two women had to drag her up to the bench. Sophie was not a bad-looking woman for a
          mulatto, and, on ordinary occasions, her yellow-tinted complexion was clear. But, at that moment, fear had
          turned her face a sort of dull-grey colour. &quot;Oh, Massa, Massa!&quot; she cried, stretching out her arms
          appealingly, with the 150</p>

        <p>tears running down her cheeks. &quot;Don't paddle me! Whip me with de switch or de strap, but don't, oh don't
          paddle me!&quot; &quot;Put her on the bench,&quot; said Randolph. Sophie, in a spasm of fear, threw herself
          upon the floor. Dinah and Milly lifted her up. Then she began to struggle and kick. But, in spite of her
          resistance, the two women soon had her stretched at full length on the bench, with her wrists and ankles
          securely fastened with the straps. Dinah now stripped her, and, since her head and feet were lower than the
          middle of her body, which was raised by the curve of the bench, the part of her person to be operated upon was
          thrown well up. She would have had a good figure except that her bottom was out of all proportion. It was too
          big. But nevertheless it was fairly-well shaped, with well-rounded cheeks meeting each other closely. Her
          thighs were large, too, and she had a sturdy pair of legs. Her skin was smooth and of a clear yellow tint.
          Randolph took up the paddle and, standing at the culprit's left side, said: &quot;Now you bitch, I'll make
          your fat bottom smart. You've cost me four-hundred dollars, and I intend to take the value out of your yellow
          hide.&quot; He raised the paddle high in the air over the trembling, crying woman, who, in dread of the coming
          stroke, drew in the cheeks of her bottom till the division between them looked like a fine line. Down came the
          paddle with great force. There was a resounding &quot;smack on the upper part of the right cheek of her
          bottom. She gave a convulsive start and gasped for breath. Then she uttered a long, shrill squeal, and, at the
          same instant, a great, red, blister-like patch, the exact size and shape of the blade of the paddle, sprang up
          on her yellow skin. 151</p>

        <p>The second stroke fell on the left cheek, and again the loud sounding &quot;smack&quot; was followed by a
          shriek. Another round patch showed red on her skin. Randolph went on paddling with great severity, laying the
          strokes alternately on the right and on the left side of her bottom and striking a fresh place each time.
          Sophie screamed and writhed, twisting herself about in agony and jerking her tortured bottom from side to side
          on the bench as far as the straps binding her would allow, at one moment arching her loins and at the next
          instant flattening herself down with a shriek as the paddle smacked horribly on the flesh. She wriggled and
          squirmed. She cried and screamed. She pleaded and prayed for mercy. But Randolph was pitiless. He gave her
          several more strokes, then finished up by applying two extra-hard smacks, one to the upper part of each thigh,
          extracting from her louder shrieks and making her writhe more convulsively. It had been a most severe
          punishment. Sophie's bottom had become a dark purple colour, the cheeks were quite swollen and the skin had a
          puffy appearance. Randolph now threw down the paddle and told Dinah to release the woman. As soon as she was
          unstrapped, Sophie rolled off the bench and lay crying loudly. While she was being paddled, the other women
          had looked on in silence, the majority of them showing no signs of emotion, but some of the younger girls
          having tears in their eyes. They had all, with few exceptions, seen each other at various times receive a
          whipping, and everyone of them, without exception, had been whipped herself more or less frequently. Randolph
          now told Dinah and Milly to take Sophie away and attend to her. They lifted the sufferer up, and, putting
          their arms round her- (she could hardly put one foot before the other)-led her wailing out of 152</p>

        <p>the hall, where they bathed her blistered bottom with cold water. Randolph then ordered a couple of the women
          to take the bench and the paddle back to the shed where they were kept. The other women and girls were sent to
          their work, and I was left alone with him in the hall. Being well aware that whipping a woman always excited
          him, I felt pretty sure that I was going to be poked. I was not wrong. Putting his arm around my waist, he led
          me into the drawing room and made me lean over the high end of the sofa. Then he turned up my petticoats, let
          down my drawers and gave me a strong rogering from behind. He then went out, and I went up to my room to make
          myself tidy, for I was in rather a dishevelled state after his vigorous onslaught. When I had removed all
          traces of what had occurred, I rang for Rosa and sent her to see how Sophie was getting on. When she came back
          she said: &quot;Dinah is bathin' Sophie's bottom with cold water. It looks drefful sore an' it's swelled up
          twice its size. I'se never seen such a bottom as dat woman's got. She won't be able to do no work for three or
          four days. I'se never had de paddle, an' I hopes I never shall. It's far wuss dan de switch.&quot; I sent Rosa
          away and went into the garden, where I sat till Randolph came back to lunch. In the afternoon we went for a
          long ride together. 153</p>

        <p>CHAPTER 17 Defeat of the Federals; Randolph goes to Richmond; I am left in charge; endeavours to stop the
          whipping of women; an eventful afternoon; the soldiers arrive; I meet Captain Franklin. The weeks passed, and,
          in their course, the tide of war flowed nearer to us at Woodlands. The Federal troops had entered Virginia,
          and many skirmishes had taken place with various results. Then came the battle of Bull Run, in which, as you
          know, the Federals were utterly defeated. When the news of the Confederate victory arrived at Woodlands,
          Randolph was jubilant. He said to me that the damned Yankees soon would be driven out of Virginia. He gave the
          field hands a couple of days' holiday with an extra supply of food and liquor; the house women also had a
          treat and were allowed to invite their sweethearts to a dance in the servants' quarters. I was very sorry to
          hear of the defeat of the Federal troops, but I did not think that they would be driven out of Virginia. A
          short time after the battle of Bull Run, Randolph was summoned to Richmond to attend the first meeting of the
          Congress of the Confederates States. Since he expected to be away a considerable time, he gave me full
          instructions about what he wished me to do regarding the affairs on the plantation. He told me that I was to
          write twice a week, telling him exactly how things were going. He want away a couple of days later, and I was
          for the second time left alone; but on this occasion I had full charge of everything at Woodlands. Randolph
          had lately been treating me with a little more consideration, and, though I had not the least love for him, I
          missed his company a little at first. Soon, however, I settled down contentedly to my solitary Me and did what
          I could to keep up the usual routine of work on the plantation, my efforts being well assisted by the
          overseers, who had been told to take any orders which I might give them. They were trustworthy men, and,
          though rather rough creatures, were always civil to me. I determined that as long as I was mistress on the
          plantation there should be as little whipping as possible, at least so far as the 154</p>

        <p>women were concerned. So I gave orders that no woman or girl was to be whipped in any way without my
          sanction. The overseers were very much surprised at my order, but I believe that they obeyed it; at any rate,
          as far as I knew, no woman or girl was whipped during the time I was in charge of the estate. The days passed
          quietly and uneventfully on the plantation, but outside of it, everything was in a most disturbed state.
          Fighting was always going on somewhere. The Federal troops were concentrating in force, and were pressing on
          Richmond. Many of the neighbouring plantations had been occupied by parties of the union soldiers, and I was
          daily expecting them to make their appearance at Woodlands. I wrote twice a week to Randolph, giving him
          particulars of everything which happened, and he wrote to me once a week, his letters always being business
          ones without a word of love. At last, the &quot;boys in blue&quot; did come. One afternoon about four o'clock
          I happened to be looking out of one of the drawing-room windows when I saw a party of soldiers-led by an
          officer and accompanied by an army wagon-coming up the avenue towards the house. In a few minutes they halted
          on the terrace, piled their arms and unpacked the wagon, which contained blankets and other things belonging
          to the soldiers. My heart began to beat with excitement, and I sat down on the sofa to wait the denouement to
          the affair. In a minute or two, Dinah ushered in an officer, who saluted me politely and said: &quot;Madam, I
          have been ordered to occupy this plantation, but I assure you that you shall not be interfered with in any
          way. I will put my men in the slaves' quarters, but I must ask you to give me a room in the house.&quot; I
          rose to my feet, smiling. It did my heart good to see the dear old blue uniform again. &quot;I am very glad to
          see you and your men, Sir,&quot; I said; &quot;I am a Northern woman and all my sympathies are with you. Take
          a seat, and I will have a room prepared for you at once.&quot; 155</p>

        <p>He took a chair, looking very much surprised. Then I rang the bell for Dinah, and gave her the requisite
          orders. The officer was about twenty-seven years of age. He was a tall, handsome man with a bronzed face,
          clear grey eyes and a long, silky-blond moustache. His uniform was a little worn, but it fitted him to
          perfection and he evidently was a well-bred gentleman. We entered into conversation, and, since there already
          was a bond of sympathy between us, we soon were chatting and laughing as if we had been old friends. He told
          me that he was a captain in the United States Army, that his name was Franklin and that he came from
          Pennsylvania. This fact made me feel even more friendly towards him, and I informed him that I also was a
          Pennsylvanian. Then we laughed and shook hands. I could see that it puzzled him to find that a Northern woman,
          and one who openly expressed her sympathy with the Union soldiers, should be the mistress of a Southern
          plantation. But he was too well bred to ask questions, and I did not volunteer any explanations. After talking
          for some time, he rose from his seat, saying that he must go and see to the quartering of his men. I told him
          that dinner would be ready at seven o'clock. Then he bowed and left the room. Sending for Dinah, I asked if
          she had seen that everything had been readied for the officer. She replied that she had seen to everything,
          and that his valise had been taken up to the room. I then told her that, now that the United States troops had
          come, she and all the other slaves soon would be set free. &quot;Oh, Missis, is dat a fact?&quot; she
          exclaimed, showing her white teeth in a broad smile. &quot;Yes,&quot; I replied. &quot;Den I'll look after de
          ossifer myself. He is a fine lookin' young gentleman,&quot; she said, bustling away. 156</p>

        <p>I went to my room and dressed for dinner, putting on one of my prettiest frocks. Then I went down to the
          drawing room to wait for Captain Franklin. Presently he came in, and, after making a bow, thanked me for the
          comfortable chamber which I had allotted him. I think he was rather surprised to find me in full evening
          toilette, with bare arms and shoulders. He had changed his rather war-worn uniform for an undress jacket and
          braided pantaloons, and he looked smart, soldierly and very handsome. Presently dinner was announced and we
          went into the dining room. The meal was a good one, and I had ordered Dinah to get out some champagne as well
          as claret and sherry. Since Captain Franklin had been campaigning in a very rough way for six months, he
          thoroughly appreciated the dainty, well-cooked dishes and the good wine, and he said with a smile that he was
          a most fortunate man in having been detailed to occupy Woodlands instead of having to live in a damp, muddy
          tent and fare on tough ration beef and hard biscuits. I laughed, saying that I was glad to hear he liked his
          quarters. Then we talked about all sorts of things, and I thoroughly enjoyed the conversation, finding that I
          had plenty to say and that I was quite able to hold my own in an argument when I was not snubbed. Captain
          Franklin was polite and agreeable, treating my opinions with consideration and never contradicting me. When we
          went into the drawing-room, he bade me good night, saying that he had to visit his men and mount a guard. He
          then went away, and I felt quite lonely. His coming to the house had excited me, and I found that I could not
          settle down quietly to anything that evening, so I went upstairs to my room and got Rosa to brush my hair for
          half an hour, then I went to bed. Some days passed, and I soon found that the presence of the soldiers had
          caused nearly all the work on the plantation to come to a standstill. The field hands did pretty much as they
          pleased-though they were still slaves, the proclamation of their freedom not having been made until some time
          afterwards. 157</p>

        <p>I had written to Randolph and acquainted him fully with the state of affairs, and had received a letter in
          which he said that he would not come back to Woodlands just then. It would be no use for him to return, he
          observed, and it would only annoy him to see his old home overrun by a lot of damned Yankees. He did not think
          that he would be able to stand it quietly, and there probably would be trouble, which most likely would end in
          shooting. He also said that he was thinking of taking a house in Richmond, and, if he did, he would send for
          me at once. He wanted me badly, as there was not a decent looking woman to be had in the place. He wound up by
          saying that, when I came away, I could leave everything in charge of the overseers-if there was anything left
          to be taken charge of. The letter was typical of the man. It was utterly selfish; there was not a word of
          tenderness in it, and he had not even thought it necessary to be silent about his doings with other women.
          However, his unfaithfulness did not trouble me in the least, and I only smiled when I read that part of his
          letter. During the time which had passed, I had seen very little of the soldiers, for they had kept well out
          of the way. But I was pretty sure that they were having a good time with the women and girls belonging to the
          plantation. I knew that Rosa had secured a sergeant as her beau, for I had seen her one afternoon in a summer
          house with him in a rather suspicious attitude. But I did not care how many sweethearts the girl had, or what
          they did to her, so long as she was at my service whenever I wanted her. And she always was. Captain Franklin
          had never obtruded his presence on me, but we met at meals and he always used to spend an hour with me in the
          drawing room after dinner. It was a most pleasant time for me, because he was always agreeable and amusing.
          Moreover, we had many ideas in common, and our natures were sympathetic. I saw that he admired me, and before
          long I felt pretty sure from the way he looked at me and by various other little signs that he had more than a
          mere liking for me, though I had but little doubt that he had guessed the nature of the 158</p>

        <p>relations existing between me and the owner of Woodlands. But whether he had or not, he always treated me
          with respect, and I could not help contrasting his courteous, gentlemanly manner with the coarse and often
          brutal way in which Randolph nearly always had treated me. 159</p>

        <p>CHAPTER 18 My first love; Captain Franklin's reserve; I employ the courtesan's art of seduction; low-necked
          dress and violet perfume; unwinding a skein of wool; I faint in Franklin's arms and what happens; the violence
          of his attack; our mutual passion; the end of the romance. From the day when Captain Franklin had come to the
          house, I had liked him, and, as I got to know him better, my feelings had gradually grown warmer until, at
          last, I fell in love with him. It was the first time in my life that I had felt this passion, and it took full
          possession of me. I always was thinking of Franklin when he was not with me. I began to want to feel his
          kisses on my lips, and I longed to lie in his arms. I had not disliked being poked by Randolph, for whom I had
          not the slightest liking therefore I could not help but think how delightful it would be to be embraced by a
          man whom I loved. Randolph had never cared for me; he had not scrupled to tell me that he was unfaithful to
          me, and, above all, he had possessed himself of me originally by most cruel means: therefore I did not
          consider that I was in the least way bound to be faithful to him. He certainly had given me plenty of fine
          clothes and a quantity of jewellery, but then-as he probably would have said himself- he had taken the value
          out of my body. Anyhow, I thought he had most fully. I became quite lovesick over Franklin-or, to put it more
          truly, though in coarser language, I wanted very much to be poked by him. But, although he had had plenty of
          opportunities, he never made love to me, even in the mildest manner, and yet I felt sure that he did love me.
          I could not determine whether his reserve was caused by shyness or by a sense of honour which would not allow
          him to make advances to a defenceless woman who was quite in his power. Three or four more days passed without
          his showing more warmth, and, since my &quot;lovesickness&quot; was increasing and there was only one cure for
          it, I determined to make the first advance. Randolph had instructed me well in all the little artifices by
          which a woman may allure a man. Thus, I decided to try the effect of one or two of them on my cold lover. 160
        </p>

        <p>I remembered that Randolph had told me that, if a man happened to be fond of perfume, the odor of it
          increased his sensual desire for the woman who happened to be wearing it. Franklin liked the perfume of
          violets, so, that night, when I was dressing for dinner, I sprinkled my chemise and my hair with the delicate
          but strong essence. I then put on my finest petticoats and a pair of very dainty drawers with deep frills of
          lace, drawn in at the knees with bows of pale blue satin ribbon. Then I cased my legs in pink, open-work silk
          stockings and put on my feet a pretty pair of bronze, leather, high-heeled shoes with silver buckles. Next I
          made Rosa lace me tightly in my corset, and finally I put on a very low-necked frock. When I was fully
          dressed, I gazed at myself in the mirror, feeling perfectly satisfied with my appearance; my dress fitted me
          to perfection, my cheeks were tinged with a faint pink colour, my eyes were bright and my bare shoulders and
          arms looked very white and plump. The above details having been attended to, I went down to the drawing room,
          where I found Franklin. I had not seen him all day, for he had been away on military duty since early in the
          morning. We shook hands and I let my hand linger in his. But he did not press it, though I saw that he noticed
          my more than usually elaborate toilette. The dinner passed quickly. We both were in good spirits, and we
          chatted and laughed merrily. When we went into the drawing room I began to exercise my arts. Seating myself on
          a footstool just under a lamp, I asked him to hold a tangled skein of wool for me while I wound it. To do this
          he would have to stand close to my knees and look down at my hands as I wound the wool. He took up his
          position in the very way I wanted, and, while I moved my arms to and fro, winding the wool, I, at the same
          time, in an apparently unconscious manner, swayed my body so that he could, if he chose, see the upper part of
          my bosom and the division between my breasts. 161</p>

        <p>At first he kept his eyes steadily fixed on my hands. But, after a few moments, his gaze was turned upon my
          half-naked bosom and I saw his eyes begin to sparkle as he looked into the depths of my corset. I smiled
          inwardly, saying to myself that I had at last made him show some sign of feeling. Affecting a serene
          unconsciousness, I continued to show my breasts and to wind the wool until it was all done. Then, putting my
          hand to my forehead and closing my eyes, I complained of a sudden faintness, saying that I would lie down on
          the sofa for a few minutes. Franklin appeared to be very much concerned. He asked anxiously if he could get me
          anything. I shook my head then, rising feebly to my feet, I stood swaying about as if I were on the point of
          fainting. He, thinking that I was going to fall, put his arm around my waist to hold me up. The moment he did
          so, I collapsed limply in his arms with my head against his breast and with my eyes closed. I ought to have
          turned pale, but I was not able to do that- however, it never struck him that it was strange that I should
          have kept my colour all through my &quot;fainting fit.&quot; With an ejaculation of pity, my stoic captain
          tenderly raised me in his arms, carried me to the sofa and laid me down upon it. I pretended to be quite
          insensible, but I kept my eyes half open and I had managed slyly to raise my skirts nearly up to my knees,
          thereby exposing my feet and legs. He then began to chafe my hands, but I saw that his eyes were fixed on my
          legs and I noticed that his face had become a little flushed. Opening my eyes, I now said smilingly: &quot;Oh,
          I am all right. It was only a slight attack of giddiness, and it has quite passed off.&quot; And, as I spoke,
          I stretched myself so as to show more of my legs and to bring into view the frills of my drawers. Still
          holding one of my hands, he sat down close beside me, looking in my face most tenderly and affectionately.
          Taking my handkerchief from my pocket, I passed it over my forehead, then I let my hand drop, as if by
          accident, on the upper part of his thighs. I felt him start and I saw a soft light shining in his eyes, which
          were again fixed upon my legs. 162</p>

        <p>Now I pressed his thighs with my fingers. Promptly his reserve disappeared. He bent down and, kissing me on
          the lips, said in a tone of passion: &quot;Oh, my darling girl! I love you! I have loved you from the first
          day I came here!&quot; His kiss had been a fervent one, but it had been tender. It was a kiss of love-the
          first I ever had received-and it made me thrill with a delicious sensation from head to foot. Throwing my arms
          around his neck, I exclaimed: &quot;And I love you too. Give me another nice kiss.&quot; Again he kissed me on
          the mouth. Then, pressing his lips upon my bosom just above the edge of my dress, he inhaled the violet
          perfume, saying: &quot;How sweet you are dearest. Violet is my favourite scent.&quot; I again closed my eyes
          and settled myself well down upon the sofa, feeling pretty sure that I soon would have my desire gratified. It
          was! Now that the ice had been broken, Franklin was no &quot;laggard in love.&quot; He felt my legs, praising
          their shape, admiring my pretty shoes and stockings and also the dainty lace frills of my drawers. Soon he put
          his hands up my petticoats, and, untying the strings of my drawers, pulled them down. Then his hands roved all
          over my bottom, and he did not neglect the &quot;spot&quot; between my thighs. However, he did not waste much
          time in dalliance. In a moment or two he prepared himself. Then, raising my petticoats, he stretched out my
          legs and, opening the way with his fingers, inserted the tip of his member into the &quot;spot,&quot; which
          was ready to receive it. Now, clasping me in his arms and pressing his lips upon my mouth, he gently but
          firmly forced the dart deeply into my body and with a few strong movements of his loins began to poke me in
          the most powerful way. He was eight years younger than Randolph, larger made and much more vigorous; the force
          of the attack almost took my breath away, while the size of the weapon stretched the sheath to its utmost
          extent. 163</p>

        <p>I felt only a sensation of intense pleasure at being embraced at last by the man I loved. All my voluptuous
          feelings were excited to a high pitch by the friction of his large member in the folds of the sensitive
          &quot;spot,&quot; so I was not backwards in the amorous combat. Pressing him to my bosom and throwing my legs
          around his loins, I met each of his strong down-thrusts with a brisk upward heave of my bottom. He increased
          the length of his strokes, his member seemed to go deeper into me, and, as the end approached, his movements
          became quicker and quicker, while I bounded under him, arching my loins, sighing and groaning in an ecstasy of
          voluptuous pain. At last, with a final, tremendous dig, he &quot;spent,&quot; while I wriggled my bottom
          convulsively and squirmed till I had received every drop of my lover's offering. Then, heaving a deep sigh of
          gratified desire, I lay quietly in his arms while he kissed and petted me. It had been a most delightful
          embrace, I had never before so thoroughly enjoyed being poked. (I think that a man always enjoys poking a
          woman whether he loves her or not; but I am sure that a woman never really enjoys a man's embrace unless she
          loves him.) After a moment or two of kissing and soft words, Franklin withdrew his still half-stiff member
          from the clinging lips which were loath to let it go. Then he pulled down my clothes and buttoned his
          trousers. I got off the sofa, and, after arranging my disordered attire, sat in an easy chair and looked with
          a smile at my stalwart lover. He smiled lovingly back, and, coming to me, lifted me out of the chair. Then,
          sitting down in it himself, he took me on his knees and, putting his arms round my waist, held me while I
          nestled close up to him with my head on his breast. After a little love talk, I told him why I had originally
          come to Virginia. Then I related the things which had been done to me, and how I had been forced by torture to
          come to Woodlands. He was moved by my story, and, when I had finished it, he kissed me and sympathized with
          me. Then he said: &quot;I am not a rich man, Dorothy, so I cannot offer you a house and luxuries such as you
          have here. But I 164</p>

        <p>love you, and, when the war is over, I will gladly take you to live with me if you will come.&quot; &quot;Oh,
          I shall be only too delighted to go to you,&quot; I replied earnestly. &quot;But are you sure you really love
          me?&quot; &quot;I do. I really love you,&quot; he answered, kissing me affectionately on the forehead. It
          delighted me to hear him say those words, and I made him repeat them. Then, nestling closer to him, I returned
          his kisses with interest, and, since my desire was not yet satisfied, I unbuttoned his trousers and let out
          the &quot;thing&quot; I wanted. He laughed, and, after a little play with my bottom, was ready for more
          action. Manoeuvring me into position on the sofa, he gave me another delicious poke. We then had a long chat,
          sitting side by side on the sofa. When it was bedtime, he wanted to come to my room and sleep with me, but I
          would not let him, for I did not want the women to know anything about my doings. So, after a long and loving
          kiss, we parted for the night. I must say, though, that I should have very much liked to have cuddled up to
          him all night &quot;spoon fashion.&quot; Next morning we met in the dining room, both of us bright and
          cheerful. After kissing each other affectionately, we sat down to breakfast with good appetites. When the meal
          was over, I took my sweetheart to my favourite little arbour, which was an ideal place for love-making, and,
          in a short time, I was sighing in his arms. There passed several days of quiet happiness. Franklin was
          constantly with me. We wandered about the garden together or sat in the arbores with our arms round each
          other's waists like the fondest of lovers. And we were lovers. I think that he really did love me, and I know
          that I did love him. 165</p>

        <p>He rogered me every day, sometime or other, and I seemed to get fonder and fonder of his embraces. They were
          done so vigorously and yet so decently. He always &quot;had&quot; me in the one position-lying on my back-and
          he never exposed my person more than was absolutely necessary. (I think a man copulates with the woman he
          loves differently from the woman he merely lusts for.) We used to talk and make plans as to what we would do
          in the future when the war was over and we were back in Pennsylvania. It was all very nice, and we both hoped
          that the fighting soon would cease, so that we might live together. In the meantime, I would have to remain at
          Woodlands. But our love-making suddenly was brought to an end. Franklin received orders to withdraw his
          detachment from Woodlands and to return to the headquarters of his regiment. I was deeply grieved at his
          having to go, and he was equally grieved at having to leave me. Yet, as we both had known, the order was bound
          to come sooner or later, and we were resolved to make the best of it. Next morning when we had finished
          breakfast, Franklin laid me on the sofa and gave me a farewell &quot;visit.&quot; Then, after bidding me
          goodbye and promising to write to me, he kissed me tenderly and left the house. I stood at the window with
          tears in my eyes, watching my lover at the head of his men marching down the avenue. When they reached the
          bend leading to the gate, Franklin turned around and waved his sword to me in a parting salute. And so ended
          my little romance. It had not lasted long, and I have never had another in my life so far. (I may as well here
          tell you that I never saw my soldier-lover again. He was killed a year later in the battle of Cedar Mountain.
          At that time, I was living in New York, but I mourned for him sincerely, for I never had ceased to love him I
          still keep the letters he wrote me and also a lock of his hair, which he gave me the day he parted.) 166</p>

        <p>CHAPTER 19 The country is occupied by the Federals; the slaves demoralized; Randolph instructs me to join him
          at Richmond; &quot;bushwhackers&quot; and their depredations. A fortnight passed, and a very wretched time it
          was in every way. I missed my lover; the slaves on the plantation were very insubordinate, and I was troubled
          at the idea of again having to live with Randolph. I had written to tell Randolph that the soldiers had left
          Woodlands and asking him when he intended to return. He had answered saying that he had not made up his mind
          what to do, whether to come back or to send for me, but he would let me know in due course. Meanwhile, I was
          to see that the affairs on the plantation were carried on as usual. I was so vexed at this letter that I sat
          down and cried. It was very easy for him, amusing himself in Richmond, to tell me to see to his affairs; but
          things had got into such an utterly disorganized state that it was quite impossible for me to keep order. I
          was only a girl, not twenty-two years of age. All work on the plantation had come to an end; the whole country
          for miles around was occupied by the Federal troops; the slaves, knowing that their freedom was at hand, would
          hardly do anything, and the overseers, under the circumstances, no longer dared to enforce the discipline by
          their usual methods. Many of the field hands had run away, and no attempt to capture them could be made,
          others had openly joined the Negro regiments which were being raised by the United States authorities. The
          majority of the house women, too, had become utterly demoralized, and several of them had gone off; only a
          few, among whom were Dinah and Rosa, had remained faithful. After a few more days, I wrote again to Randolph,
          telling him that things were getting worse and that I was afraid to remain any longer by myself at Woodlands.
          This time I received a letter saying that, since things at that moment were in such a bad state in Virginia,
          it was no use trying to keep the plantation going any longer. I was to tell the overseers that Randolph would
          continue to pay them their salaries if 167</p>

        <p>they would remain on the estate and do the best they could for him. He had taken a furnished house, and I was
          to go to him as soon as possible. The house at Woodlands was to be shut up and left in charge of Dinah and the
          other women who had remained. I was glad to get at last some definitive instructions, for the strain on me had
          been almost more than I could bear, and I had got into a very nervous state. Sending for the faithful Dinah, I
          told her that I was going to join her master in Richmond and that I intended to start in three days' time. I
          also informed her that she was to take charge of the house, and I gave her instructions about the shutting-up.
          Then I wrote to Randolph, telling him when to expect me. Next day I saw the overseers and gave them their
          employer's message. The men said they would remain on the plantation and do the best they could to prevent
          things from going to ruin. But they added that there was no chance of getting the slaves to do much work as
          long as the Federal troops were in the neighbourhood. I spent the following day packing my trunks and settling
          affairs with Dinah and the other women. They were all sorry that I was about to leave them, though delighted
          at the idea of being left alone in the house to do as they pleased. The only way for me to get to Richmond,
          which was thirty-two miles distant, was by driving. I intended to start at four o'clock in the afternoon, in
          order to escape the heat of the day. All the horses still were in the stables,- and some of the grooms had
          remained, one of them being an old and faithful Negro coachman named Jim, who had taught me to ride and in
          whom I had perfect confidence. I sent for him and told him that I wanted him to drive me to Richmond and that
          he was to have the pair-horse buggy ready at four o'clock. &quot;Very well, Missis,&quot; he said. &quot;I'll
          put you through all right, if I kin. But don't you take no money or joolery along with you, 'cos de road 168
        </p>

        <p>nowdays is 'fested wid dem low-down cusses of 'bushwhackers'; an' if we was to come across any of dem, dey
          would most sholy rob you.&quot; It had never struck me that there would be any danger in the drive to
          Richmond, but, now that Jim had mentioned the &quot;bushwhackers,&quot; I remembered that I had heard several
          stories of the lawless doings of these men. &quot;Bushwhackers,&quot; I must tell you, were low white loafers
          who, while pretending to act as guerrillas against the Federal troops, were in reality highwaymen who robbed
          and sometimes murdered defenceless people, whether they were Northerners or Southerners. Bands of these
          ruffians infested the Southern States during the war. I sent Jim away, but I decided that I would take his
          advice. Going upstairs, I opened my trunks, and, taking out all my jewellery, I locked the articles in a safe
          which had been built in the wall of Randolph's bedroom. The rest of the day wore slowly away. I was restless
          and nervous. I could not eat my dinner, and I went to bed early. 169</p>

        <p>CHAPTER 20 Farewell to the plantation; on the road; stopped by the &quot;bushwhackers&quot;; robbed,
          kidnapped and the awful consequences. I had a good night's rest and got up next morning feeling well and also
          much calmer in my mind. After breakfast I made a few final arrangements and, at four o'clock, the buggy with a
          fine pair of horses was driven around to the terrace by Jim. The two trunks which I intended to take with me
          were brought down and put into the buggy. I shook hands with Dinah and Rosa, my two favourites, bidding them
          goodbye and telling them to take good care of everything in the house as well as they could. Then, climbing up
          into my seat, I waved a general farewell to all the other women who had come out to the terrace to see me off.
          They shouted in shrill chorus: &quot;Goodbye, Missis!&quot; Now Jim touched the horses with the whip and we
          started on our journey. It was a beautiful afternoon, but very hot, though there was a faint breeze stirring;
          however, since I was lightly clad, I did not find the heat oppressive. We soon were out of the avenue, and, as
          the comfortable buggy rolled smoothly and quickly along the road, the rapid motion caused the warm scented air
          lightly to kiss my cheeks. My spirits rose and I had a feeling of exhilaration such as had long been a
          stranger to me. I was not looking forward to seeing Randolph, but I felt glad that I was at last free from the
          load of care which had been weighing me down during the past few weeks at Woodlands. The road which we were
          travelling was a good one, and, before the war, there always had been a great deal of traffic on it. Now it
          was almost deserted. We did not meet a single vehicle until we had gone several miles. There were very few
          pedestrians. To pass the time, I talked to Jim and was rather amused by his quaint but shrewd remarks on
          things in general. When I told him that all the slaves in the South most likely would soon be set free, he
          remarked in his own jargon that no doubt it would be very nice to be free, but that, after all, freedom would
          not fill his belly, and that he would not be able to make a living if Mr. Randolph did not keep him. Old Jim
          had been born at Woodlands, and had never been out of Virginia. 170</p>

        <p>Since there was no necessity for hurry I told Jim not to press the horses, so we trotted along at an easy
          pace. By six o'clock we had completed half our journey. We then reached the top of a very steep hill and
          entered a long stretch of road running through a thick wood. Jim had just pulled up the horses to give them a
          short rest when four rough-looking men suddenly appeared from the bushes and covered us with their revolvers.
          &quot;Drop the reins and hold up your hands, you nigger!&quot; shouted one of the men. Exclaiming in a low
          tone, &quot;By gosh, Missis, de 'bushwhackers' has got us,&quot; Jim held up his hands, while I, dreadfully
          frightened, uttered a shriek and, cowering down, averted my eyes from the threatening muzzles of the pistols.
          Two of the men lowered their weapons and came to the side of the buggy, while the other two kept their
          revolvers levelled at us. Then one of the &quot;bushwhackers,&quot; a burly, black-bearded ruffian, said with
          an oath: &quot;Get out of the buggy, the pair of you; but don't attempt to run away, or you'll both git holes
          bored in you.&quot; We got out and stood on the road, side by side. Jim was quite unmoved, and, though I had
          been alarmed at first, I was beginning to feel less frightened. (I thought that the men would merely take
          everything they wanted and then let us go.) Seeing that we had no idea of escape, the &quot;bushwhackers&quot;
          returned their pistols to their belts and began their work of pillage. The traces of the horses were cut, then
          one of the men mounted one of the animals and, leading the other, rode off at a brisk trot down the road. It
          never had struck me that they would take the horses, and I wondered how I was to get to Richmond. The three
          men who had remained now threw my trunks out on the road and, breaking them open, tossed out all my dresses
          and linen, searching for articles of more value than women's clothing. Finding nothing, they broke into loud
          curses and kicked my things all over the road. The 171</p>

        <p>black-bearded man, who appeared to be the leader, then told me to hand over my purse. I did so, but since
          there was only five dollars in it, he gave vent to his feelings of disappointment in a fresh volley of oaths
          which made me shiver. The men then went a short distance away and talked with each other in low tones,
          occasionally bursting out laughing while I stood in suspense, wondering what was going to happen next. After a
          minute or two, the leader came back to us and, addressing Jim, said: &quot;See here now, old darkie, I know
          whar you come from, so jest you start off and go back or it'll be the worse for you. Now git.&quot; Jim gazed
          at me for a moment with a dog-like expression of faithfulness in his eyes and a resolute look on his rugged
          black face. Then, turning to the man, he said firmly: &quot;No, Sah, I'll not leave my Missis.&quot; The man
          drew his revolver and, pointing it at Jim, said savagely: &quot;You damned nigger! We'll take care of your
          mistress, and, if you don't start right away, I'll put a bullet through your woolly head.&quot; Jim never
          flinched, but stood quite still, looking steadily at the man. I am a coward, but at that moment I felt brave.
          I could not allow Jim to sacrifice his life uselessly. It struck me that the men meant to keep me prisoner to
          extract money for my ransom, so I said: &quot;It will be no use to remain with me, Jim. Go back to the
          house.&quot; &quot;Oh, Missis,&quot; he said, &quot;I don't like to leave you. But if you tink it ain't no
          good my stayin', I'll go an' praps I may be able to do sumthin' for you.&quot; He then walked slowly away,
          turning around every now and then to look back at me. 172</p>

        <p>I watched the faithful Negro, who I know would have sacrificed his life for me, until he had passed out of
          sight down the slope of the hill. Then I burst into tears, feeling utterly forlorn. Two of the men now picked
          up some of my things and made them into a bundle, while the leader said to me in a quiet tone: &quot;Come
          along with us and we'll put you up for the night in our shanty. Tomorrow I daresay you'll be able to get a
          lift on to Richmond if you want to go there.&quot; Then, taking me by the arm, he led me through the bushes at
          the side of the road into a path. The other two men followed, and we walked through the gloomy wood for about
          a mile until we came to a small shanty. The men led me inside, and, since it was quite dark, one of them
          lighted a rude lamp. It was a squalid-looking hovel; the floor was the earth, the walls were of squared logs,
          the ceiling was made of shingles and the furniture consisted of an unpainted wooden table, three or four
          benches and stools, a couple of tin buckets holding water and three rough-looking beds covered with deerskin.
          On the open hearth a fire of logs was smouldering, and there were a few cooking utensils scattered about. Thus
          was the place where I was to pass the night. 173</p>

        <p>CHAPTER 21 In Bill Jackson's gang; the supper in the shanty; I am violated by the three ruffians;
          &quot;spread-eagled&quot; and stark naked; observations on the difference in the members of the ruthless
          scoundrels. I had been a little relieved at hearing that I was to be allowed to go in the morning, but I did
          not like the prospect of spending the night in the dirty shanty with the three men. One of them threw some
          fresh logs on the fire, and, when it had burned up, fried some bacon, which he put on the table in the frying
          pan, along with a piece of corn bread, a bottle of whiskey and some tin plates and pannikins. The men, each
          one drawing his sheath knife, then sat down to the rough supper. They offered me some, but I could not eat a
          morsel, though I drank some water; then, sitting down wearily on a stool at the far end of the room, I watched
          my captors as they devoured their food. All three were coarse-looking fellows. The black-bearded man, who was
          called Bill Jackson, was about forty years of age. The other two, who addressed each other as Frank and Tom,
          were respectively about thirty and thirty-five. While the meal was in progress they did not talk to each
          other, nor did they speak to me. But every now and then one of them would glance at me with a smile on his
          face. Strange to say, it did not strike me that my person was in danger. When they had finished eating, they
          smoked corn-cob pipes, chatted a little and passed around the bottle of whiskey until it was finished. But
          they all were perfectly sober. Jackson now rose from his seat and, coming over to me, said with a coarse
          laugh: &quot;We've been greatly disappointed at not havin' found anythin' in your trunks wuth a dollar to us.
          We ain't men who works for nothing', so we're bound to git sumethin' out of you.&quot; &quot;Oh,&quot; I
          exclaimed eagerly, &quot;I shall be glad to give you anything you want. If one of you will come to Richmond
          with me tomorrow, my husband, Mr. Randolph, will pay you the money.&quot; 174</p>

        <p>I called him my &quot;husband&quot; thinking to impress the men. But they burst but laughing, and Jackson
          said: &quot;We know better than that. Randolph is not your husband, an' I guess he would not pay much for you.
          But whether he would or not, nary one of us will go to Richmond to see. There is rather a prejudice again' us
          in the city, and if we was to go there we would never get away again. So, since it is impossible for us to
          make any money out of you, we intend to make you pay us in another way. We are going to poke you.&quot; Aghast
          and utterly horrified, I sprang to my feet and, bursting into tears, exclaimed in a choking voice: &quot;Oh,
          don't do such a thing to a defenceless woman! I will send you any money you like if you will not touch me. Oh!
          let me go!&quot; They laughed. Then my terror changed to anger, and I threatened them with the consequences
          which would follow if they dared to outrage me. But they only laughed more. I tried to wheedle them and coax
          them into letting me go, but without effect. I begged and prayed them to spare me. But all my tears, threats,
          coaxing and entreaties were useless. In fact, my abject fear and intense misery seemed to amuse the wretches.
          Jackson said: &quot;Now see here, young woman, you may jest as well shut up. We are going to poke you. Will
          you take it quietly, or will you not?&quot; &quot;No! no! no!&quot; I cried. &quot;I will not let you do it to
          me. You shan't do it to me! Oh, you miserable cowards! Don't dare touch me! Oh you beasts! You wretches!&quot;
          The more I raved in my rage and fear, the more they laughed. &quot;Well,&quot; said Jackson, &quot;if you
          won't take it quietly, you'll have to take it fighting. Now lads, let's strip the little bitch and
          'spread-eagle' her.&quot; The three then seized me. I fought, kicked, scratched and tried to bite, at the same
          time uttering loud shrieks. But, in spite of my frantic 175</p>

        <p>struggles, the men easily carried me to one of the beds and laid me on it. Then, holding me down, they began
          to strip me, turning me over and over, wrenching off the buttons and breaking the strings of my garments, then
          pulling them off roughly until I was stark naked except for my shoes and stockings. I resisted with all my
          strength, screaming, crying and begging them not to &quot;do it&quot; to me. Laying me on my back, they now
          stretched out my arms and legs as widely as possible, fastening my wrists and ankles with ropes to the side of
          the bed. I was thus &quot;spread-eagled,&quot; and entirely at their mercy. Standing beside the bed, they
          looked down upon me, their eyes gleaming with lust as they scanned every part of my naked body, while at the
          same time they made admiring remarks on my shape and on the whiteness of my skin and on the golden colour of
          the hair shading the &quot;spot.&quot; From words they soon proceeded to deeds. They began to feel me, and I
          had three pairs of hands on my body at the same time. While one was squeezing my breasts and pinching the
          nipples, another was pulling the hair on the &quot;spot&quot; and tickling the lips with his finger, while the
          third was feeling my thighs and bottom. Then they changed places, so that at last everyone had felt my
          shrinking body from head to foot. They touched me roughly. Their hands were coarse and hard. I was sick with
          disgust, and I cried and trembled, but I had given up screaming. When the wretches had felt me to their
          hearts' content, a difficulty arose. Each man wanted to be the first to &quot;have&quot; me, and so they came
          to high words, but no one would give way. At last one of them suggested that they settle the matter by cutting
          a pack of cards, the man who cut the highest being allowed to poke me first, and the next highest to follow.
          This was agreed to. Then a dirty pack of cards was produced and cut by the men in turn. The youngest man cut a
          knave, Jackson came next with a ten and the third man cut a seven. 176</p>

        <p>You can imagine what I felt while my body was being disposed of in such a way. It had been intensely
          revolting to me to be pawed all over by three men simultaneously, but it would be still more revolting to be
          poked by the three coarse ruffians in succession. The thought was maddening, and I lay writhing in my bonds,
          my bosom heaving, my heart swelling and the scalding tears running down my scarlet cheeks. The man who was to
          &quot;have&quot; me first unbuttoned his trousers, letting out his member, which stood stiffly erect. I could
          not help looking at it with a sort of horrible fascination, noticing that it was long but not very thick.
          Saying, &quot;here goes for the fust poke,&quot; he threw himself upon me like a tiger seizing its prey.
          Clasping my naked body in his arms, he tried to get the weapon into the sheath. At first he could not succeed,
          for, though my extremities were tightly secured, I could move my loins. I twisted about as much as was
          possible, and thus for some time prevented his entering me. The other men meanwhile stood looking on, laughing
          and jeering at their companion's vain efforts and telling him that he didn't know how to &quot;get into&quot;
          a woman. The struggle lasted for some time, but at last I became exhausted and lay still a moment. Then,
          before I could recover my breath and renew the fight, the man got his long &quot;thing&quot; into me up to the
          roots and began to poke me furiously, at the same time pressing his lips to mine with loathsome kisses. Filled
          with disgust, I lay shuddering under him while he worked away at me. He was highly excited, so the end soon
          arrived. I could not help receiving his copious discharge, and I had no feeling but one of loathing, so I
          never moved at the supreme spasm. He got off me, saying in a tone of vexation: &quot;She is a damned bad poke.
          I thought my thing was long enough to have stirred her up, but the bitch had no more life in her than a log of
          wood.&quot; 177</p>

        <p>The brutes laughed. The man Jackson then made ready for the assault, displaying to my horrified eyes a
          tremendous weapon which he shook up and down, saying with a horrid laugh: &quot;I'll bet this yer little
          'thing' will make her squeak if it does nothing else.&quot; And he added: &quot;This'll be the first time, to
          my knowledge, that I've ever had a buttered bun.&quot; He then got on the bed between my widely stretched
          legs, but he did not at once attack me like his predecessor. Turning to the other two men, who were looking on
          grinning, he said: &quot;I always like to play with a woman before poking her.&quot; Then he played with me,
          feeling my breasts with both hands and sucking the nipples one after the other. Now he passed his hands over
          every part of my body, stroking my thighs, pinching my bottom and pulling the hair on my &quot;spot.&quot;
          Finally he thrust his finger deeply inside me, hurting me dreadfully and making me utter a shriek. My body
          quivered and I entreated him not to torture me in such a way. Removing his finger, Jackson now inserted his
          member-(I made no useless resistance this time)- and with some difficulty forced the enormous engine into
          place. Then, gripping me firmly with his hands under my bottom, he began to poke me slowly with long thrusts,
          each time drawing the dart out till only the tip was left between the lips, then driving it in again with
          great force, each tremendous dig shaking me all over and making me wince. Since the parts were stretched to
          the utmost by the great size of the column as it worked up and down inside me, I suffered considerably and
          uttered tortured cries of pain. Jackson spun the affair out as long as he possibly could, while I lay groaning
          in misery under the terrible battering. Oh! It was horrible! At last he quickened his movements. Then, in a
          few seconds, he &quot;spent,&quot; and the jets of fluid spurted up me while I heaved a sigh of relief as I
          178</p>

        <p>felt his great &quot;thing&quot; shrink in size inside the folds of my &quot;spot.&quot; My disgust was
          increasing. He withdrew, saying: &quot;Well, she certainly ain't much of a poke, but she's got a nice little
          'spot' and my big 'thing' made her squeak, as I said it would.&quot; Then turning to the third man, he said
          laughing: &quot;But you'll be able to get into her easy enough, Tom. She's well greased by this time.&quot;
          The man laughed, saying: &quot;Yes, her rolls are well buttered.&quot; Then he prepared himself, and I saw
          that he was the smallest made of the three, though the instrument he displayed was in full readiness for the
          assault. He lost no time in preliminaries, but at once laid himself down on me and with his two forefingers
          separated the lips of the &quot;spot.&quot; Then he penetrated me without the least difficulty and began to
          poke me quietly, but with plenty of vigour, so that in a few seconds I was for the third time deluged with hot
          juices. Again I suffered a sickening sensation of disgust. The villain now got off me without making any
          remark, and I thought that the horrible ordeal was over and that the men would release me. But, to my horror,
          they did not, though I begged them piteously to let me go. &quot;We've not done with you, my girl,&quot; said
          Jackson, smiling evilly. Leaving me tied up on the bed, weeping and shivering with shame and despair, the men
          now filled their pipes and, sitting down on stools, chatted coolly with each other about the way I had behaved
          while being poked. While they talked, they gazed at my naked, palpitating body. When they had smoked their
          pipes, they came to the bedside again. 179</p>

        <p>Faint and sick with disgust, shame, fear and horror, I wailed pitifully, beseeching them to have mercy on me
          and not to touch me again, saying that it would kill me. I might have spared my breath. They only laughed and
          Jackson observed that a woman could take twenty men without being a bit the worse. Again I begged and abjectly
          prayed them to let me go, but nothing moved the brutes. They had neither pity nor compassion. However, I need
          not enter further into the details of my martyrdom; it will suffice to say that all three poked me again, one
          after the other, and, when the last man had withdrawn his member from my quivering body, the receptacle was
          filled to overflowing by the six copious inundations which it had received. I was by this time in a
          half-fainting state; there was a cold sweat on my forehead, my flesh was bruised by the rough way I had been
          handled and my whole body was jerking convulsively, while unutterable disgust and loathing overwhelmed me. The
          knaves now unfastened my wrists and ankles, which had red marks around them where the ropes had chafed the
          skin. Then Jackson threw a blanket over my naked body, telling me that I might go to sleep if I could, as they
          had got as much out of me as they wanted. Drawing the blanket over my head, I huddled myself up, crying
          miserably. The men took no further notice of me, but sat smoking and talking in low tones for about half an
          hour. Then, leaving the lamp burning, they threw themselves, still wearing their clothes, upon the other beds.
          In a short time, I knew by their snoring that they were fast asleep. My mouth was dreadfully parched and my
          &quot;spot&quot; was throbbing painfully. I wanted a drink, so, slipping quietly off the bed, I got a tin cup
          and, going to the bucket of water, quenched my thirst. Then I bathed the red and swollen lips of the
          &quot;spot&quot; and washed from my body all outward traces of the horrible pollution. This accomplished, I
          dressed myself in my tumbled garments and lay down again upon the bed, hoping to forget in sleep the horrors
          through which I had passed. 180</p>

        <p>But, though I was physically and mentally worn out, sleep would not come to me. I shall never forget the
          misery of the long night I spent in that shanty, tossing and turning on the dirty bed. I was feverish at one
          moment and chilly the next But all the time I felt sick with disgust. Moreover, I was haunted by a dreadful
          fear that the wretches might not let me go in the morning. 181</p>

        <p>CHAPTER 22 Daybreak and breakfast; renewed fears and forced kisses on the mouth; I am liberated; the friendly
          carrier; arrival at Richmond and meeting with Randolph. I don't think that I ever once lost consciousness
          during the weary hours, and I thought that the morning would never come. But at last I saw the welcome
          daylight showing through the clinks in the shutter. Presently the men woke and, getting off the beds, stood
          yawning and stretching for a moment or two. Then, looking at me, they laughed, making remarks about my pale
          cheeks and red eyes, while I lay in dire suspense, fearing that one or other of the ruffians would take it
          into his head to poke me again. But to my intense relief no one touched me. The window was opened and a fire
          was lighted. Some bacon was fried and a pot of coffee was made. Then the men sat down to breakfast, ordering
          me to sit at the other side of the table and join them in their meal. With downcast eyes and flaming cheeks, I
          seated myself opposite the three brutes who had outraged me so shamefully, and, since I was very faint, I
          tried to eat a bit of bread, but it stuck in my throat. However I managed to drink a pannikin of the milk-less
          coffee, which, bad as it was, refreshed me a little. When the &quot;meal&quot; was over and the men had
          lighted their pipes, I raised my eyes and, addressing Jackson, reminded him of his promise to let me go.
          &quot;Oh, do please let me go,&quot; I pleaded earnestly, bursting into tears and stretching my hands towards
          him appealingly. &quot;You have nearly killed me. Surely you won't be so cruel as to keep me.&quot; He looked
          at me for a short time and my heart seemed to stand still. At last he said: &quot;You are a pretty girl, and,
          though you are a bad poke, you are better than nothing. We'd like to keep you for further doings, but you'd be
          in our way, so we'll let you go. I'll put you through the woods to the road, and then you can either go back
          to Woodlands or run to Richmond. Both are the same distance away, about sixteen miles. You can come along at
          once if you like.&quot; 182</p>

        <p>A dreadful weight was lifted from my heart, and I rose from my seat eagerly. &quot;Oh, I am quite ready to
          start,&quot; I said. He laughed. &quot;All right,&quot; he said, &quot;but first you must shake hands with us,
          bid us goodbye and give us each a nice kiss on the lips.&quot; So I had to kiss each of the ruffians in turn,
          bidding him goodbye. As I did so, each man put his hands up my clothes and felt the &quot;spot.&quot; Jackson
          then left the shanty, and I followed him. He evidently wished to confuse me as to the exact position of the
          place, so he led me by devious paths through the woods for at least a couple of miles before bringing me out
          onto the road. After pointing to the direction in which Richmond lay and telling me that I could not miss my
          way, he disappeared in the bushes. There was not a person in sight, and I sat down on a log at the side of the
          road, uncertain whether to go back to Woodlands or on to Richmond. But I did not quite see how I was to get to
          either place, as I could not possibly have walked the distance. Under ordinary circumstances I was a good
          walker and would have thought very little of a walk of sixteen miles, but at that moment I was weak and faint,
          sore and stiff, and every movement of my legs caused me pain. Not knowing what to do, I began to cry in sheer
          helplessness, thinking what a dreadfully unfortunate woman I was in every way. But a bit of luck came to me. I
          had been sitting by the roadside for about ten minutes when I saw in the distance a farm wagon coming along
          the road. When it had drawn close to me, I saw that it was driven by a respectable-looking middle-aged man.
          Rising from my seat on the log, I tearfully asked him if he would kindly give me a lift towards Richmond. He
          pulled up his horse at once and said that he would. Then, giving me his hand, he helped me into the wagon and
          made me as comfortable as he could, looking rather curiously at me but asking no questions. I gave 183</p>

        <p>him a short account of how I had been stopped on my journey and robbed by &quot;bushwhackers,&quot; but I was
          silent as to the other things which had been done to me. The stranger was full of sympathy for me and anger
          against the &quot;bushwhackers&quot; in general, who, he said ought all to be lynched. Then he added: &quot;I
          reckoned that there was suthin' wrong when I seen a lady like you a sittin' by the roadside cryin'. Dern this
          war! There's no law or order now in the whole state of Virginny. I wish I was out of it and back in
          Connecticut, whar I come from.&quot; I was glad to hear that he was a Northerner. The fact seemed to give me
          greater confidence in the man. (I had grown frightened and suspicious of all Southerners.) I told him that I
          also came from the North, and that I heartily wished to be back there. On hearing that, he insisted upon
          shaking hands. Then he informed me that he would take me all the way to Richmond and that we could expect to
          get there in about three hours. The wagon was heavily laden, so we jogged along the road slowly and almost in
          silence. He was a taciturn man, while I, as you may suppose, was not inclined to talk at that moment. In fact,
          it was as much as I could do to prevent myself from crying. When at length we reached the outskirts of the
          city, the man said most kindly that, if I would give him my address, he would drive me to it. I thanked him
          gratefully, telling him where to go, and, in about half an hour, we reached the house which Randolph had
          taken. It was a comfortable looking, three-storied building standing in a garden and situated in one of the
          best parts of Richmond. The kind man got out of the wagon and helped me down. I asked him to come into the
          house and see &quot;my husband,&quot; who would like to thank him and also reward him for the service which he
          had rendered me. But the good fellow said that he wanted no reward and that he was glad that he had been able
          to help a Northern lady in distress. Then he bade me goodbye, and drove off. 184</p>

        <p>I knocked at the door, which was opened by a good-looking, smartlydressed, white servant-girl. I asked her if
          Mr. Randolph was at home. She looked curiously at me for a moment, then asked civilly if I was the lady Mr.
          Randolph had expected to arrive the previous night? I said that I was, and she at once asked me to come in.
          She ushered me into a handsomely furnished room where I found Randolph seated at lunch. He did not rise from
          his chair, but sat staring at me in surprise, noticing my pale face, red eyes and generally draggled
          appearance. After a moment, he said in an aggrieved tone, &quot;Why, Dolly, what an object you are! Where on
          earth have you been? What has happened to you? I expected you at eight o'clock last night. Where is Jim and
          the buggy?&quot; I had not expected to be received with much show of affection, but his cold manner annoyed me
          very much. I was in need of sympathy and kindness at that moment. &quot;Oh, don't bother me with
          questions,&quot; I said sharply. &quot;I have had hardly anything to eat for twenty-four hours and I am faint
          with hunger, so I mean to have something to eat and drink before I tell you what happened.&quot; He looked
          quite surprised at my unwonted display of spirit, but he drew a chair to the table for me, poured a glass of
          wine and helped me to a cutlet. I really was famished, so I made a good meal, drank a couple of glasses of
          wine and had a cup of black coffee. Then, feeling much better, I sat in a comfortable easy chair and told him
          how Jim and I had been stopped the previous night by &quot;bushwhackers&quot; who had taken the horses, broken
          open my trunks and robbed me of everything I had in my possession. But I could not bring myself to tell him
          that I had been outraged by the three men. He listened attentively to all I told him and, when I had finished,
          he asked: &quot;Where did you pass the night and how did you get here this morning?&quot; 185</p>

        <p>I had expected the questions and was ready with the answers. &quot;I stayed in the woods all night&quot;-so I
          had, in the shanty-&quot;and this morning I met a man going by with a wagon. He brought me on to the
          city.&quot; I do not know whether Randolph thought I was keeping back something or not, but he did not ask me
          a single awkward question. He was very much vexed at the loss of his two valuable horses, but he was rather
          amused at my description of the way the &quot;bushwhackers&quot; had kicked my clothes about in disgust.
          &quot;Damn the thing,&quot; he said, &quot;I would not have sold those horses for less than eight-hundred
          dollars. But we can easily replace your finery, Dolly. It was lucky you left your jewellery behind. I will go
          to the police and give them the information, but I am pretty sure that nothing can be done. The whole country
          is in such a disturbed state. When you want to go to your room, ring the bell and Clara, the girl who let you
          in, will attend to you.&quot; He went away, and I remained reclining in the easy chair for a short time. Then
          I rang the bell, and, when Clara came, I told her that I wished to go to my room. She showed me upstairs to a
          long, airy, prettily-furnished bedroom with an adjoining bath, and, as soon as she had gone away, I stripped
          myself and had a most refreshing bath, scrubbing myself all over with scented soap till at last I felt that my
          body was thoroughly cleansed from all outward impurities. When I had dressed myself, the girl came back and
          brushed my hair, and, though she was quite aware that I was not Randolph's wife, her manner was respectful. I
          put a few questions to her, and, since she was by no means reticent, I soon found that Randolph had been in
          the habit of poking her whenever he felt inclined. However, the knowledge of that fact neither surprised nor
          annoyed me. It was just what I had expected to hear from the moment I had seen the girl's pretty face and neat
          figure. 186</p>

        <p>After Clara had finished brushing my hair and had left the room, I lay down upon the bed and fell into a
          profound sleep. When I woke, I saw by the clock on the mantelpiece that it was seven o'clock. I had slept for
          four hours and I felt quite fresh. The colour had come back to my cheeks, my eyes had lost their heavy look
          and the ill-treated &quot;spot was feeling fairly easy. I was just about to get up and go downstairs when
          Randolph entered the room, and, coming to the bedside, looked down upon me. &quot;Well, Dolly,&quot; he said,
          &quot;I suppose you've had a good sleep. You're looking all right again, so I intend to have a poke to give me
          an appetite for dinner. It will be as good as a cocktail for me, and I will make you 'cock up your
          tail,'&quot; he added laughing. I loathed the very idea of being poked again, and I heartily wished that there
          was not such a thing as a male organ in the world. (Six times in less than twenty-four hours the horrid
          weapons had pierced my poor little &quot;spot,&quot; and now it was going to be transfixed for the seventh
          time!) However, I knew that if I made any objection it would only make Randolph angry and excite his
          suspicions, so I did not say a word. The scoundrel now proceeded to &quot;cock up my tail&quot; by laying me
          in a curved position over the side of the bed, with my feet on the floor. Then, turning up my petticoats and
          letting down my drawers, he took a long look at my bottom. He stroked it and spanked it harder than was
          pleasant, saying coolly: &quot;Well, Dolly, I must say that I have not seen a prettier bottom than yours or
          spanked a plumper one since I came to Richmond.&quot; He then began to ram at me from behind with evident
          pleasure to himself, but with pain to me, for, though outwardly the &quot;spot&quot; was all right, the inner
          lips were excoriated. 187</p>

        <p>I suffered a good deal, and I had to clench my teeth to keep from crying out. But to prevent his suspecting
          that anything was wrong, I worked my bottom backwards and forwards to meet his thrust as if I had been really
          enjoying the embrace, and, when he &quot;spent,&quot; I wriggled myself briskly. I was exceedingly glad when
          all was over and he had withdrawn his member from the sore &quot;spot.&quot; However, he was pleased with me,
          and, giving me a kiss, he complimented me on the way I had done my share of the work. After the necessary
          ablutions, we went down to dinner, which was a good one and also well cooked, the waiting being done by a
          neatlydressed but rather elderly white parlour maid. (All the servants in the establishment were white women,
          whom Randolph had taken over along with the house, the owner of which had gone to Europe with his wife and
          family at the outbreak of the war.) During the progress of dinner, Randolph and I talked about the state of
          affairs at Woodlands. He asked me a number of questions, all of which I was able to answer fully and
          truthfully. Strange to say, he did not ask me a single question about the Federal Officer, Captain Franklin.
          When dinner was over and we were in the drawing room, we conversed about the war. Randolph observed that most
          of the planters in the Southern States would be ruined if the Federals eventually proved victorious in the
          struggle. He further said that, though he himself would be hard hit by the abolition of slavery, he
          fortunately had a large sum of money invested in foreign securities, so that, whatever happened, he would
          still be comparatively a rich man. At eleven o'clock he told me to come to bed, adding that he wanted to have
          a good naked roll with me. I was glad to go to bed, but I did not look forward with pleasure to more
          love-making. However, I followed him meekly upstairs to the bedroom. 188</p>

        <p>After locking the door, he lit all the candles, so that the chamber was brilliantly illuminated. Then he made
          me take off all my clothes, doing the same himself. When we were both stark naked, he put his arm round my
          waist and waltzed round the room with me until I was quite out of breath. All the time, his bare breast was
          pressed against my naked, palpitating bosom and his stiff member rubbed against my belly. Occasionally he
          stimulated my flagging steps by applying a smart slap to my bottom. When he was tired of &quot;dancing&quot;
          he lifted me on to the bed. Then, holding me in his arms and twining his legs around mine, he rolled over and
          over, clasping me in a tight embrace, finally finishing up by laying me on my back and &quot;sabering&quot; me
          lustily. The deed done, he allowed me to put on my chemise-I had no nightdress-and to get between the sheets,
          where he soon followed me. I thought that he was done with me, but I was very much mistaken. He was in great
          form, so I got very little sleep. He kept playing with me at short intervals all night, besides poking me
          thrice in different positions each time. It was late the next morning when we got up, and it was noon before
          we had finished breakfast. Randolph left the house on some business or other, while I sent for my dressmaker
          and ordered a fresh stock of frocks, hats and bonnets. I then went out shopping and bought a full supply of
          dainty undergarments, silk stockings and shoes. Randolph always liked me to be prettily dressed, and he never
          objected to paying the bills for the clothes which adorned me. But he did not give me much money to spend; in
          fact he was rather stingy. In a few days I was completely fitted out again, and was able to go out with him by
          day or night, wherever he wished me to accompany him. 189</p>

        <p>CHAPTER 23 The battle of Fair Oaks; departure for New York; no more sights of beaten slaves; Randolph's fresh
          &quot;amours&quot;; he starts for Europe; my last spanking; the only reminiscence of &quot;tenderness&quot;; I
          begin housekeeping. A few weeks passed. Randolph had paid a visit to Woodlands and had found that everything
          on the plantation was in a most neglected state, but that the house had been kept in order by Dinah and the
          other women. When he came back, he brought me my jewellery. A week after his return, the battle of Fair Oaks
          was fought. The Federal troops drew closer to Richmond, and everything in the city became more dull and
          wretched than ever. On my former visits I had liked the place well enough, for it had been brisk and lively
          and there always was something to be seen. But now there were no amusements of any sort. The shadow of the war
          was over everything and everybody. It was a dreary place to live in. I was very tired of it, and I much rather
          would have been at Woodlands. Randolph also had grown very tired of Richmond and of the everlasting fighting
          which was going all around and which never seemed to be decisive in any way, though hundreds of lives on both
          sides were sacrificed. At last he made up his mind to leave the South altogether and to go to New York, taking
          me with him. So he told me to pack up, and to be ready to start in a week's time. I was delighted to receive
          the order, and I soon had everything in perfect readiness. The day of our departure arrived. We left Richmond
          and in due course reached New York. As it turned out, we had left the city just in the nick of time, for, a
          few days after our departure, the place was regularly invested by the United States Troops, and, after that,
          it became a difficult matter for persons, even if they were noncombatants, to pass through the Federal lines.
          We put up at one of the best hotels in New York, and, for a time, I was as happy as a woman in my precarious
          position could be. I was away from the dreadful fighting. I could come and go as I liked without any 190</p>

        <p>fear of being whipped by lynchers or outraged by &quot;bushwhackers.&quot; I had plenty of pretty clothes of
          all sorts and also a considerable amount of jewellery. Randolph frequently took me to places of amusement, and
          I saw that I always was admired. He was fairly kind to me and he gave me more money to spend than he ever had
          given me before. I was delighted to have escaped the horrid Slave States, and I was glad to know that I never
          again should see a poor slave woman writhing in agony and shrieking for mercy while her naked bottom was being
          wealed by the switch or striped by the strap or blistered by the paddle. I had determined, whatever happened,
          never to go back to the South. The weeks slipped by. Randolph had made a number of friends, both male and
          female, so I saw very little of him by day and he very frequently stayed away from me all night. I knew that
          he went with other women-in fact, he made no secret of his amours-but the knowledge of them did not trouble me
          in the least. I took a poke from him whenever he chose to give me one, but I never tried to get him to embrace
          me. I had a number of admirers myself, and could have had plenty of poking had I wished, but I was always
          faithful to Randolph, not from any feeling of honour towards him, but simply because I did not care for
          strange men. (At that time there was no necessity for me to allow myself to be poked if I did not wish to be.
          Captain Franklin was the only man who ever had &quot;had&quot; me with my own consent during the whole time I
          lived with Randolph.) As the days passed, I saw less and less of Randolph, and, even when he was with me, he
          never touched me in any way. Meanwhile, his manner towards me became very cold, though he never was actually
          rude to me. I guessed what it all meant. He had grown tired of me, and I had a presentiment that he soon would
          turn me adrift. However, I always had known that our relations would come to an end sooner or later, and that
          then I should have to do what many a woman has had to do when 191</p>

        <p>she has found herself deserted by the man by whom she has been ruined. Before long, Randolph gave me the news
          which I had been expecting. One morning, after an absence of three days, he came to me and said that he had
          something to tell me. My heart gave a jump. I knew what he was about to say, but I made no remark. He said:
          &quot;I am going to Europe with a party of friends, so I cannot take you with me. In fact, Dolly, the time has
          come for us to part altogether. But, though I am leaving you, it is not through any fault of yours. You have
          always been a good-natured girl and you have done whatever I asked you. Therefore I wish to do the best I can
          for you. I intend to buy you a little house and to furnish it well for you. I also will give you a sum of
          money to start with. You are only twenty-two years of age, you have a pretty face and a very good figure. You
          also have lots of good clothes and a quantity of jewellery. You soon will make friends and I am quite sure
          that you will manage to get on very well here in New York.&quot; It was a hard way of putting the matter
          before me and the tears rose to my eyes. But nevertheless I felt a certain amount of gratitude to him for what
          he intended to do for me. He had ruined me, but he might have cast me off with nothing at all. I thanked him,
          and he gave me a short kiss, saying that he would take me out next day to look for a house. He then went away,
          leaving me to think over my future prospects. The prospects did not seem very bright at that moment. But they
          might have been worse, so I made up my mind to face my position as bravely as I could. I did not see Randolph
          any more that day or night, but the next day, after lunch, he came for me and we looked at several houses in
          various parts of the city. I shall not lengthen my story by telling you of our house hunting; it will suffice
          to say that eventually he bought this house, furnished it 192</p>

        <p>throughout and engaged a couple of white female servants. I afterwards sent them away and got two coloured
          women, whom I have at this moment in my service. I find them much easier to get on with, and also far more
          faithful than white servants. When everything was in order, Randolph brought me here one afternoon, handed
          over the title deeds of the house and gave me a thousand dollars. We then sat down and had a chat while he
          drank a glass of wine and smoked a cigar. When he had finished, he rose from his seat, saying with a laugh:
          &quot;You know, Dolly, that I am fond of whipping a woman's bottom. Now I don't suppose that I shall ever have
          a chance of doing such a thing in Europe, so you must let me give you a farewell spanking, a real smart one. I
          did not like the idea at all, and a cold shiver ran down my back, for I knew that he would hurt me dreadfully.
          But I had not the strength of mind to refuse his farewell request, so, in a rather faint voice, I said:
          &quot;I will let you spank me, but do not be too hard upon me. You know that I cannot bear pain.&quot; Taking
          a handkerchief from his pocket, he tied my wrists together, a proceeding which alarmed me. &quot;Oh don't tie
          me!&quot; I exclaimed. He laughed, saying: &quot;I am going to whip you as if you were a naughty slave girl,
          so your hands must be tied to prevent your putting them over your bottom during the spanking.&quot; Thoroughly
          frightened, I made some feeble remonstrances, but he seized me and, sitting down on a chair, placed me in the
          orthodox position across his knees. Then he turned up my petticoats and took down my drawers. &quot;Now,&quot;
          he said, stroking my bottom, &quot;don't make too much noise, or the servants will hear you.&quot; 193</p>

        <p>Then, holding me firmly, he began to spank me very severely. Oh how hard his hand was, and how it did sting!
          I burst into tears, wriggling and squirming about on his thighs. I could distinctly feel his stiff member
          pressing against my belly. Clenching my teeth and holding my breath, I suppressed for a short time the cries
          which rose to my lips. But at last the stinging pain became so intense that I began to squeal shrilly, kicking
          my legs about in anguish and begging him to stop. He went on spanking me until my bottom burned and throbbed
          in a most agonizing way and I screamed out as loudly as I could. Then he stopped, and, laying me in a stooping
          position over the end of the sofa, he poked me while I was still crying and smarting with the pain of the
          horrid spanking. When all was over, he untied my wrists and laid me on the sofa, while he stood beside it,
          looking down at me with a smile on his face as I lay with the tears trickling down my cheeks, all my clothes
          rumpled and my drawers hanging about my ankles. My face was red, but I am sure that my poor bottom must have
          been much redder judging from the way it was throbbing and tingling. (It was black-and-blue the next day.)
          Bending down he gave me a kiss, saying laughingly: &quot;There, Dolly, that is the last spanking-and the last
          poke you will ever get from me.&quot; &quot;It was very cruel of you to have spanked me so severely,&quot; I
          said tearfully. &quot;I cannot understand why you should have taken pleasure in giving me such dreadful
          pain.&quot; He was not a bit sorry for having whipped me with such wanton severity. He said: &quot;Oh, you
          soon will find that many other men besides me are fond of spanking a woman till she squeals.&quot; (I since
          have found that such indeed is the case: many men are very fond of taking a woman across their knees. I often
          have been asked to allow myself to 194</p>

        <p>be spanked, but I have never consented. Randolph is the only man who ever has taken me on his knees for a
          spanking.) He went on, laughing at his own poor joke: &quot;You know, Dolly, when a man sets up a new
          establishment, he generally gives a housewarming. Well, I have given you a bottom-warming instead. I have
          always admired your bottom, and I shall always have a pleasing recollection of it as it appeared today. It
          looked very pretty while the plump white cheeks were blushing at the touch of my hand.&quot; He then kissed me
          again on my tear-bedabbled face, bade me goodbye and calmly left the house, leaving me lying on the sofa,
          sore, angry and indignant. Fortunately, the servants had not heard the shrieks which I had uttered while being
          spanked. I lay there quietly till the intense smarting pain of my bottom had somewhat subsided, then I
          fastened up my drawers and, going into the bedroom, bathed my flushed face, thinking to myself what an utterly
          heartless man Randolph was. There certainly had never been any sentiment in the relations between us, but I
          thought that he might have parted with me in a more tender way. However, I had no tender feeling for him after
          the way he had treated me, and so the only &quot;tenderness there was about our parting was the
          &quot;tenderness&quot; of my sorely spanked bottom. Randolph sailed for Europe the next day. I have neither
          seen him nor heard from him since. But I know that he remained abroad until the war was over, then returned to
          Woodlands, and I believe that he is there now. 195</p>

        <p>CHAPTER 24 The last of my tyrant; I make other friends; how my present life began; hate of the Southerners
          justified. An soon as I had got fairly settled in my new home, I put five-hundred dollars in the bank and went
          on housekeeping with the remainder of the money. At first I did nothing but amuse myself, and I thoroughly
          enjoyed being mistress of a house of my own without anyone to bother me. But, after a time, money constantly
          was going out and none was coming in, and, since I had determined not to touch the five-hundred dollars in the
          bank except in case of absolute necessity, I saw that I should have to replenish my purse. There was only one
          way for me to do it. I did not like having to adopt the wanton life, for notwithstanding all I had gone
          through, I still was to a certain extent a modest woman. But I made the plunge and, since I had a pretty face,
          a well-shaped figure, good clothes and handsome jewellery, I attracted admiration and soon made a number of
          friends. I hated the life at first, and I dislike it still, but I have new grown accustomed to it-like other
          women in the same position. Nearly four years have passed since that time, and I have done well in the
          &quot;profession.&quot; I have many good friends, some of whom are rich and liberal. I have saved money and am
          still saving, and I have had a couple of offers of marriage. Perhaps I will get married some day if I get an
          offer from a man whom I could love, for, though I am what I am, I will never marry a man unless I love him.
          About a year ago, I paid a visit of a couple of days to Philadelphia and, while there, I heard that Miss Dean
          still was unmarried and that she was as charitable as ever. It had never got to be known that she had been
          shamefully whipped during her stay in the South. I need hardly tell you that I did not call upon her, though I
          should have liked to have seen and spoken to the sweet woman again. 196</p>

        <p>My story is finished, and now you know why I said that I hated the Southerners. Don't you think I have good
          reason to hate them? They were the cause of all my misfortunes. If they had not whipped me and ridden me on a
          rail, I should not have been outraged by three ruffians, and I should not have been compelled to adopt my
          present life. 197</p>

        <p>CONCLUSION I remained in New York for three weeks after Dolly had related her story to me, and I frequently
          paid her a visit, not only because she was a pretty little woman and a splendid poke, but because I had grown
          to like her and because I also pitied her very much. She certainly had been hardly dealt with by men while she
          was in the South. On the day when I bade her goodbye, I gave her my address and told her that I should like to
          hear from her if she ever felt inclined to write to me. I think that she was a little sorry to part with me,
          for there were tears in her eyes and her voice shook when she wished me goodbye. The next day I sailed from
          New York in the Scotia, and, after a rather rough passage, arrived in Liverpool, from which I went straight
          home and settled down to my usual life. Six months afterwards, I received a letter from Dolly, telling me that
          she was going to be married to a man in a prosperous business. She described him as a good chap, a few years
          older than herself, who loved her, and whom she really loved. I was glad to hear the news. She was a
          good-tempered, amiable young woman who, though weak in many respects, would, I was convinced, make a good and
          faithful wife to the man she loved. I wrote her a letter of congratulations and sent her a wedding present,
          which she acknowledged in a nicely-worded letter. Our correspondence never was renewed, but I hope she is a
          happy wife. The poor little woman, who had suffered so much from no fault of her own, deserved, after all her
          troubles, to enjoy some good fortune in... THE END</p>
